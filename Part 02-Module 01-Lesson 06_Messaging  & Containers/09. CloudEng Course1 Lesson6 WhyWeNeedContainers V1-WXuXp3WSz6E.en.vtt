00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
Enterprises are adopting container technology at an explosive rate.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.860
Docker is the leading container technology.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.085
There are several container orchestration services

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.070
that help you manage your Docker clusters.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.219
Kubernetes is a container orchestration system

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.789
for Docker containers similar to Docker Swarm.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.504
Why are containers so popular?

00:00:23.504 --> 00:00:27.674
A container consists of everything an application needs to run.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:32.039
The application itself and its dependencies like libraries,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.070
utilities, configuration files, etc.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.774
all bundled into one package.

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:40.850
Instead of having to rebuild your application and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.140
its environment from scratch as it moves from environment to environment,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.570
say from development to production,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.390
you can easily move the entire container from

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.435
environment to environment without any issues.

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:57.665
Each container is an independent component that can run on its own.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:01.219
Let's say you have a huge monolith application,

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.730
that you're migrating to a micro-services architecture.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.569
The micro-services architecture decomposes large complex monoliths systems into discrete,

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.219
individual stand-alone components that can communicate among themselves,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.355
working together, or with external systems.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:23.435
A Docker container works well with the micro-services use case because

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:29.640
each micro service is its own independent component with no interdependencies.
