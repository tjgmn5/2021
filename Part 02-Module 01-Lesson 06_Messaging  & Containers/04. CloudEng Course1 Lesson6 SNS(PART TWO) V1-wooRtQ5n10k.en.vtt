00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's review an existing SNS topic.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.564
From the AWS management console,

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:09.525
type in SNS and click on simple notification service.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:12.345
This brings you to the SNS dashboard.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.735
Notice I have four topics and for subscription.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.804
Let's click on topics.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:21.140
To see more detail about an existing topic,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.699
click on its name.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.800
Notice with this topic,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.510
I have one confirmed subscription and one pending confirmation.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.405
This is pending confirmation because the user has not confirmed the subscription yet.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:38.450
You can also see subscriptions by clicking

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.780
on the subscriptions option on the left-hand pane.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.704
This will allow you to see across all of your topics, the different subscriptions.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:50.960
This has been a quick look at the SNS dashboard.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.700
You have an upcoming exercise where you will create your own topics and subscriptions.
