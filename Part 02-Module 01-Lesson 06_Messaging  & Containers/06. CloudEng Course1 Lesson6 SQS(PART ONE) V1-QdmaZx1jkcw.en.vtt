00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
Amazon Simple Queue Service, SQS,

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.419
is a fully managed message queuing service that

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.410
allows you to integrate queuing functionality in your application.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.708
With SQS, you can send, store,

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:18.524
and receive messages between applications without losing messages.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:23.729
SQS offers two type of message queues; standard and FIFO.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.865
Standard queues offer best effort ordering,

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:31.289
while SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.060
processed exactly once in the exact order they were added to the queue.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.435
Let's say you've created a course registration system,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.455
and to improve scalability,

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:46.204
you send account creation and course registration messages to a queue.

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:49.309
In order for a student to register for a course,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.704
their account must first be created then they can be registered.

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:56.854
The ordering of these steps is very important.

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:59.509
You do not want a student to attempt to register

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.405
for a course before their account is created.

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:04.460
Since ordering is important,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.189
a FIFO queue should be used in this case.
