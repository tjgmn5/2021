00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
In this lesson, I introduced you to

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:04.980
messaging and queuing services like

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.625
the simple notification service and a simple queue service.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.970
You learned that notifications can be sent via email or

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.750
text messaging using a publish/subscribe model.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.495
You also learned that queues are typically used for system to system messaging.

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.300
Next, you were introduced to containers,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.230
and learned that containers work well with a microservices architecture.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.725
Because each microservice is its own independent component that can be containerized.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:36.300
Remember, the elastic container service, ECS,

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:41.299
is an orchestration service that helps you efficiently manage Docker containers.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:46.949
Next, I will teach you about tools to help you manage your AWS account.
