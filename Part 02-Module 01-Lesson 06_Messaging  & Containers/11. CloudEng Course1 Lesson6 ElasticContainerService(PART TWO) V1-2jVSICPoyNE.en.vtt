00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's look at an existing ECS cluster.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.714
From the AWS management console,

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:08.925
I'm going to type "ECS" and click on it.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.425
The first thing that I want to show you is what's called a task definition.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.350
This is an application blueprint that

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.350
describes the container information for your application.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.635
In this case, the app is a web application.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.315
Let's click on this.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.165
Let's click on the second revision.

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:29.329
Notice, among other things,

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.909
the task definition defines the memory and the CPU needed.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:40.159
Overall, the Amazon ECS service launches and maintains copies of task definitions.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.429
That's why we saw multiple versions on the previous page.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.975
Next, there's a concept of what's called a cluster.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:50.030
So let's click on that.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.804
A cluster is simply a set of container Instances running the container agent.

00:00:55.804 --> 00:00:58.579
Let's click on the ''Default Cluster.''

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.109
Within this cluster, there is one web application running,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.265
and it's shown here.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.200
Let's click on the service name.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.189
Next, I'm going to click on the "Load Balancer Name".

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.174
I'm going to click on the "Load Balancer name".

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:17.560
Again, here I'm trying to get to the URL for the web application.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.530
Notice that's shown here,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.299
under DNS name.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.129
Let's copy that.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:25.974
Let's open a new web browser,

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:28.614
to bring up our web application.

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:32.359
Now, we see a "Congratulations" message.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.859
This is simply the welcome message from the web application that shows

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.989
we have a web app up and running on a container in Amazon ECS.

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:47.039
This was a quick look at an existing ECS container.
