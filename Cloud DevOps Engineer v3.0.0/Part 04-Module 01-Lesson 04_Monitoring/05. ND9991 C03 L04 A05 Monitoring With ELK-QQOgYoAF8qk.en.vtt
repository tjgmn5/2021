00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.179
So you may start to notice some commonalities between Prometheus

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:12.269
and ELK Stack and other Open-Source technologies in the sense that with these,

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.164
you are having multiple components that are there in order to achieve the desired result.

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:21.219
With Prometheus, you have Grafana,

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.570
which you're using to do your actual graphing and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.920
aggregation of those numbers in a displayable manner.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.975
With ELK Stack, which is made up of three components;

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.395
Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:39.855
Although from my perspective,

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:44.369
the order is a little bit wonky because Logstash is what

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:49.054
sends the logs that have to be aggregated under Elasticsearch,

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.085
and Kibana is what displays the logs.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:56.750
But lack doesn't have quite the same ring to it as ELK.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.929
So anyways random aside.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.760
Let's go ahead and dive right into in Salinas onto our server.
