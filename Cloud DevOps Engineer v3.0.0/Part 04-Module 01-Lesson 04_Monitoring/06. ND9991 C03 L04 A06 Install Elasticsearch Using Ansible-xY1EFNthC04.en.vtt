00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
Let's go ahead and just get clone that.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.570
Great. So now we've got that downloaded.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.460
Let's go inside to that subdirectory.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.030
First, we're just going to take a quick look at the README.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.810
We're going to make this really easy.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.245
We're just going to do a simple installation.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.540
So we're going to copy this for

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.600
high level playbook,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.405
copy and paste.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:43.420
Now we're going to set up our roles,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.490
let's make sure that we match the naming that we

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.480
have inside of our playbook, so Elasticsearch.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.849
Now we're going to move all of the components

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.550
that are part of that role into that directory.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.440
I'm just doing tab complete here to just get all the files here.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.350
Great. Now let us set up our inventory file.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.680
Now we're ready to kick off our playbook.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.655
When do I specify inventory file?

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:07.240
We're going to do main.yaml.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.840
Wonderful. Solutions, let that take care of installing Elasticsearch for us.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.700
In this case, Elasticsearch is already

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.570
installed so we're just going to move on to the next step. Great.
