00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
Now finally, we're on the topic of actually sending our logs into our full stack.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.585
The primary means of doing this is with Logstash,

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.710
but let's just take a brief sojourn into Kabana.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.615
Kabana has really been improved over this past, not even that long.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:29.460
So we can go straight to our IP address and because of our engine X proxy,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.520
it takes us straight into Kabana without us having to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.825
type an extra port number or anything like that.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:40.940
So the interface has really been upgraded significantly I feel like.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.455
We have all these canned box to solutions that they present to us right on our homepage.

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:52.410
So let's click on under Logging, "Add log data."

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.310
We see here all of the types of logs that it works with,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.845
which is truly quite impressive.

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:05.690
But we're concerned primarily with Logstash at this exact moment.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.590
So we're going to click on that.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.410
We see here that we actually have support for four different operating systems,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.970
everything from Mac, to Windows,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.360
to Debian, and Red Hat.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.040
So Debian also covers Ubuntu,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.265
Ubuntu is a Debian based operating system.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.840
Red Hat also covers CentOS,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.145
and the main suite of it is for the paid version which is with all the Red Hat.

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:43.370
But CentOS is the free and open source version of Red Hat.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.485
So this is just like a huge leap forward for open-source.

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:58.010
So we're going to start with setting it up on just locally on our VM that we have here.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.720
But as a next step I think setting up from your computer to

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.200
go into here is actually pretty cool and can

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.895
bring home some of the points of how this technology works.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:19.490
So let's go ahead and just take a look at the configuration file for

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.470
file beat because we specifically want to check the authentication.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.970
Right here we see for the output for elastic search,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.590
we specify the hosts,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.985
and in this case we're running the elastic pushing of logs from the same host.

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:48.395
So we're just talking to local host and we're specifying our username.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:52.680
The default one is elastic and then we set a password.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.910
Great. So let's go ahead and just start file beat.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.515
We're going to switch back to Kabana,

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:15.715
and we're going to come into our discovery place.

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:19.365
This gives a drop down and we're just going to select,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.150
I saw a file beat here.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.680
We're going to change the time period two this week,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.960
which is a pretty broad spectrum here.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.255
We can see here just all of the capability that we have built into Elastic Search,

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:40.910
which is being able to work with a huge number of fields.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.485
You're not limited it's really just based on what it detects built into these logs.

00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:55.580
So that in a nutshell is what we get with Kabana and Logstash.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.010
Great, let's move on.
