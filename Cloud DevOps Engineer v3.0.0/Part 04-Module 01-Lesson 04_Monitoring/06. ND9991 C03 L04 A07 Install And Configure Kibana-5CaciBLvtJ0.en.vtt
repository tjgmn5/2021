00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.865
Already. Now, that we have elasticsearch to aggregate our lawns,

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.765
let's set up the front end to the service, Kibana.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:14.920
We're going to start by just doing an 'apt install Kibana'.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.620
Something important of note.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.255
You need to make sure that the version numbers of

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:35.929
all the components that you're using match up correctly.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.475
So if you're using 7.2.0 version of Kibana,

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:44.825
you have to use 7.2.0 version of Elasticsearch,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.660
and likewise of Logstash.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.204
So we've installed Kibana.

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:57.280
Now, we need to install Nginx.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.890
Nginx is already installed.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.210
Let's go ahead and take a look at the Nginx configuration.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.795
We want to go into, etc/nginx/sites- enabled default.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.894
Here, what you'll see,

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:25.214
is we have a list here on port 80,

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:30.545
and we're just effectively using the Nginx as a proxy to another service,

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:32.965
and then other service of course is Kibana.

00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:34.870
So our server name,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.020
we're just using an IP address here for this lesson.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:42.310
We're setting off basic restricted access,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.665
which we're going to set up very shortly,

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:50.965
and we're proxy passing this to on the back end of the Kibana service,

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.924
which is running on local host at port 5601.

00:01:54.924 --> 00:02:01.114
Let's go ahead and set up our Nginx configuration, authentication for Kibana.

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:04.109
We're going to do this with this below command,

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.259
"echo "kibanaadmin: 'openss/passwd-apr1'".

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.685
Great. So this just provides some very basic authentication,

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.800
and it enables us to use,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.905
so we're using the username with pass in here,

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:33.974
and then the password we've typed in here,

00:02:33.974 --> 00:02:37.659
to get into our Kibana.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:45.294
So now, we can configure our elastic search connection string in Kibana.

00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:50.659
So for this, we're going to take a look at, etc/kibana/kibana.yml.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.395
The lines that we are concerned with, are the elasticsearch.username:"elastic",

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:03.460
and elasticsearch.password:" So this is where

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.955
you're going to choose a much better password than the one that we've chosen here.

00:03:06.955 --> 00:03:11.469
But this is the same password that you selected in your previous step,

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.840
when you set a password for elasticsearch.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.439
Great. So let's go ahead and start our services.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.564
Great. Already, we have completed our setup of Kibana.

00:03:43.564 --> 00:03:45.949
Let's move on to the final component,

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.759
where we actually put some contents into that log aggregation.
