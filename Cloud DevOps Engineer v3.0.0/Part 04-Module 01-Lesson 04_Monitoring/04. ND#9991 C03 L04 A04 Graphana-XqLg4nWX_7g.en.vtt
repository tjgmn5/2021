00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.264
Okay, so now we have Prometheus fully configured,

00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:09.779
but the question is well how do we graph it?

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.474
One of the answers to this question the most common one grafana.

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:20.144
So let's go ahead and get grafana set up on our system.

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:24.719
So we're going to first start with downloading

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:30.960
grafana and then getting some dependencies of it and then starting the grafana service.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.600
Running the grafana service and configuring Prometheus to talk to it.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.515
So we download grafana with our control command.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:49.954
Pretty quick. Now we're installing end user and lib font config.

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:53.914
We start the grafana server and we enable

00:00:53.914 --> 00:00:59.659
grafana server so that the next time the system restarts will have grafana still.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.539
So now we're going to punch in our IP address.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:15.770
3-18-2-2-1-1-16 and we're going

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:23.629
to need to put in the correct IP address and in order to get to grafana.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.640
So you're going to go to a port 3,000 to pull

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.305
grafana and I'm going

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:49.410
go ahead and just log in with the standard credentials.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:57.289
So we're going to put in admin for the first time and admin and click login.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:06.249
Great. So now we've logged in for the first time and we're able to start configuring

00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:14.469
it and we already

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.264
have set up a data source here.

00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:22.733
So what you're going to want to do is for a new DataSource,

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:25.270
you'll set the name to Prometheus and you'll set

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.170
the type to Prometheus and you're also going to set

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:35.199
the IP address and port number that Prometheus is running on and let's go ahead

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:46.049
and make sure going to run this as pseudo.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.475
Okay great.

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:57.539
So let's go ahead and see if we can look at some of the data for Prometheus.

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.234
So we just restarted Prometheus here.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.200
It's just going to take a second.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.050
So we see here our first little bits of data here.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.225
Head chunks is just coming in,

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:26.599
query durations but everything else is like the graphs are just starting here.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.259
So there's just the bare minimum of data.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.110
Great. So now we have configured grafana to be able to talk to the Prometheus backend.
