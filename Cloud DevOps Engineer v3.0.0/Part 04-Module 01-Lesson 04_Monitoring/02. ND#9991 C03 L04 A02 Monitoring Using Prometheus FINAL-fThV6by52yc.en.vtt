00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.395
Okay, so now we're going to be setting up Prometheus which is

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:08.040
a great monitoring solution because it includes

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.750
a lot of flexibility and it's pretty easy to configure and install.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.364
So we're just going to go about and setting it up with Ansible

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:20.835
which makes our job easier as a DevOps engineer.

00:00:20.835 --> 00:00:23.515
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.700
We're going to start by installing

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.065
Ansible and so let's go ahead and do that on the command line.

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:35.255
We're also throwing in Python pip as well into this process.

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:40.040
We're going to need that, because that's going to be a dependency in order to get

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.740
another tool that we're going to use with

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.865
Ansible as part of the installation process for Prometheus.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:51.170
So we're installing pip install talks,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.805
talks is used for Version Management,

00:00:54.805 --> 00:01:01.830
and now we're doing a git clone of the cloud alchemy and school Prometheus.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.345
Now, we have to go ahead and set up our directory structure in an Ansible like fashion.

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:20.955
So we're do a make directory_ p for include the parents, roles cloud alchemy.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:26.185
The rationale is that we're setting this up so that we can place all of

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:32.980
our component parts of this Ansible job and then be able to kick it off.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.475
So now we're going to place all of these sub-directories.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:39.865
Just doing the tab complete makes it really easy to type these,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:44.500
defaults /handlers/ meta/ molecule/

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.240
tasks/ templates/ vars/ and we're just going to throw that inside of that directory.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.560
We just created.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.290
So now we're just going to quickly look at

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.760
that directory and we're just going to verify those component parts.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.085
Now, we're just going to review the [inaudible] quick

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:29.380
because we're going to grab the root level playbook,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.840
and we're just going to make a very small change

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.150
to this but we're going to include most of this.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.530
So I'm going to exit out of there and we're going to edit main.YAML.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.625
We're going to paste that contents and then we're getting rid of

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:46.955
one of those targets which is not inside of our name space.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:51.430
You can see here in the roles cloud alchemy Prometheus.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.090
So that needs to match very closely at the directory that we created

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.455
earlier rolls- without alchemy Prometheus if those don't match it won't work.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:05.080
So we have a root level playbook and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.565
now we're printing an inventory file and we're just doing this on local host.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:17.055
So we'll type in local host and Ansible connection equals local.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:20.560
I'm going to save and exit the file.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.475
So now we can go ahead and just launch that playbook with Ansible playbook.

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:32.450
We do -I for the inventory file and

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.510
now the playbook name and we'll hit "Enter" and watch it do its thing.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.655
So now it's gathering facts, Installing Prometheus,

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:50.090
configuring for Prometheus and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.050
just verify that we're seeing all okay's for the most part.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.055
So now we have completed our running of the playbook.

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:04.215
We've created our main YAML, our inventory file,

00:04:04.215 --> 00:04:12.535
our role and we're ready to do note exporter and configure that to talk to Prometheus.

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:15.920
Great. So now we've successfully installed

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.420
Prometheus and we're going to go in our next lesson.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.520
We're going to configure note exporter to actually send some data into it.
