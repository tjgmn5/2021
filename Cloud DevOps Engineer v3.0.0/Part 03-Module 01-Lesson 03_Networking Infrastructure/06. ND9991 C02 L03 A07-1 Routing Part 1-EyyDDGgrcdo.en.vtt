00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
So looking back to our reference document,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.760
we have just one thing left for our infrastructure to be complete,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.570
at least when it comes to the Foundation Network,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.080
and that is routing.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.830
So let's go ahead and take a look at what I have for routing.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.910
There's two things that you need to be aware of,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.850
one is creating route tables,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
which is a place where you can define routing rules, and then, of course,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.095
the specifying those rules which are going to make

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:31.070
whatever is private is going to actually make it private,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.740
and whatever is public is going to be made public in this case.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.685
So let's get to the fun part.

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:40.790
So here in the network reference document that I'm using,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.675
you're going to see we have route tables and route table associations,

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.400
and also route table rules.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.200
So let's take that and copy it over.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.970
Going to start over here.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.990
So you can see it's quite a significant amount of code that's

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.980
done and we're going to copy it over to our file,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.590
and then we're going to discuss each one of those lines.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.810
Go over here, paste.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.530
This time we're going to make sure that we have

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.540
the proper indentation before we continue.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.110
It's just this resource here.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.865
We're going to move it over,

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:40.760
tap once, and that's correct.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.530
The others are moved, I believe,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.895
as well so we need to bring them back.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:56.670
One tap, we're going to do Shift tab all the way to the end here, Shift tab.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.340
Now everything should be properly aligned on the same column.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.730
So this is the NatGateway we created, NatGateway number 2,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:14.700
and the first command that you will see here is a route table creation.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.635
We're going to display, in a moment,

00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:20.425
the documentation on all these resources.

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:23.900
You are not required to memorize any of these resources.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.020
So if you know you need a routing table,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.740
I'll show you how to get that information from the official documentation.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.835
So in this case, we're creating a route table.

00:02:35.835 --> 00:02:38.610
We just call it route table here in our script,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.809
and we attach it to a specific BPC by using the ref function from CloudFormation,

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.600
which refers to not a parameter in this case,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.940
but actually a resource that we're creating in this very same script.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.780
We also see that we assign a name tag,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.780
and we'll just call it public routes with the name of the project.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.985
Here is our first routing rule.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.210
A routing rule in AWS is

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.415
basically where you're telling traffic to go from and where traffic is going.

00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:22.035
This is necessary so that you can basically say any resource within this subnet,

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.180
needs to abide by these rules,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.760
otherwise, block the traffic.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.675
Let's take a look. So this particular resource,

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:36.035
this route, it has the DependsOn rule.

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:39.820
It depends on an Internet gateway attachment properly working.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.590
Again, this is just a hint for CloudFormation,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.750
so this may not be necessary.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.295
You have to experiment with this.

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:47.700
This is probably not necessary,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.595
but is a good guarantee that this is going to be used when

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:55.700
the Internet gateway is attached to the BPC and

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.150
not in any other time during the creation of these resources.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.105
So we have a route table ID.

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:05.460
So that means is we're attaching

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.950
this rule to this route table that we just created a moment ago,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.180
and the rule is this: the rule is,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.320
if you're routing traffic to any address,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.460
this 0.0.0.0/0 means a wildcard address or all addresses,

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.240
they will be routed to this particular resource.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.720
In this case, we provide a gateway ID,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.135
in this case, the Internet gateway that we created.

00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:37.250
So in routing, when you specify a 000,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.525
that's like a wildcard,

00:04:38.525 --> 00:04:42.305
which means just send all traffic to over here.

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:46.160
Something else that you need to know is that routes go

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.600
from very specific to the least specific.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.080
So the default route that we mentioned a moment ago,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.575
where we have all the traffic within the BPC being able to talk to one another,

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:02.210
that will take precedence.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.460
What that means is if I'm trying to reach

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.975
a server that is just right there and the next private subnet over,

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:13.300
it's not going to go to the outside because of this new rule that we're creating.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.345
It's just going to reach that server because the rule is more specific.

00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:21.170
Any 10.0.1 that would be within

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.595
the BPC realm will be executed for and this rule will be ignored.

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:30.155
However, if you're trying to reach udacity.com,

00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:32.345
it will be outside,

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:35.130
and they apply this rule.
