00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
I believe that's it for this,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.290
so we can go ahead and perform another test.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.095
However, the stack already exist.

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.290
So now we need to do a update stack,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.370
not a create stack.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.090
Another thing important to mention is that when we're creating this resources,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.270
it knows that it needs to wait for

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.010
the Internet gateway to be created and operational before it gets attached to the VPC.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.645
The same thing for the VPC.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:30.540
It will not attempt to do an attachment unless

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.425
it can find the VPC and it's already operational.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.555
So let's save our file,

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:41.320
and let's try to run the updates script this time.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.380
The parameters remain the same,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.620
we're going to use the same stack that are already exist,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.040
which is ourdemoinfra, and the same files.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.570
Let's see what happens.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.980
We get a stack ID, which is a confirmation that it is updating the already existing one.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.270
So let's take a look.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.405
So you can see we have an update in progress event.

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:17.130
Let's see what it does.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.915
Because we're allocating actual network infrastructure,

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.585
as you keep adding more resources,

00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:46.050
the stack may take several minutes to a long time to create.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.580
Especially when you have load balancers and all the scaling groups,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.665
it can take a significant amount of time.

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:53.620
For now, I don't believe we have too much going on,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.600
so they should finish within a few seconds.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.215
As you can see now, we have an update_complete event.

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:04.825
So our infrastructure update works.

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:09.380
Let's take a look at the events.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.110
Now we have an update clean up and an update complete and if we look,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.615
we usually looking at the create_complete.

00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:20.420
Yes, we have an InternetGatewayAttachment,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.225
and we have an InternetGateway created.

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:24.830
So now we have our VPC,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.260
associated with an InternetGateway which allows for inbound and outbound traffic.
