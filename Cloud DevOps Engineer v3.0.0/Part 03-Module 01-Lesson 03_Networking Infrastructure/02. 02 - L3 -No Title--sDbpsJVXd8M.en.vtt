00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.819
Before we get started, let's take a look at

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:07.720
the CloudFormation script that we did as a test.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.609
This is the script that we had.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.789
It shows a resource, which is a VPC,

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.599
a description and a value for the site or blog of that VPC.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.190
Now, there's a few things here.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.670
This is what a normal CloudFormation script will look like.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.650
It would have many resources.

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.140
However, it needs to have at least one resource.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.825
This is something you need to remember going forward.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.750
You must have at least one resource,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.310
otherwise you'll get an error.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.140
Right. By the way,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.200
we're going to be seeing a plenty of errors ideally,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.770
and we're going to get to troubleshoot them as we go.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.550
That's a good thing because you will get plenty of situations in the real world.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.899
Well, you'll be creating resources that may already exist or you forget to clean them

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.060
up and hopefully we get to see that so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.460
that we get to troubleshoot those errors in real time.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.394
Now, the description field,

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.450
in this script it's totally optional,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.325
you don't need that and you'll see

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:12.900
other sections such as parameters and outputs that will go over that slowly.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.388
Now, in terms of workflow,

00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:30.155
we are obviously going to be updating this file and adding a lot of text,

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:31.864
a lot of resources,

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:33.619
a lot of code in general.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.900
So in order to do that,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.805
we're going to add some sections,

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.340
we're going to discuss them, we're going to test them,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.640
and we're going to create the stack and we're going to update it.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.700
Now, as we do that of course we are going to be typing in many commands.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.710
So we have to make our lives easier not to type so much.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.159
So let's discuss some helper scripts that I have for you.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.513
So if I were to create a stack in CloudFormation,

00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:11.849
I would have to type AWS CloudFormation create-stack

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:15.250
and provide the name of the stack,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.164
some texts, a template body,

00:02:18.164 --> 00:02:20.745
which is the file that we're editing,

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:25.599
the parameter file if any which we haven't discussed yet.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.789
So as you can see it's a very lengthy command,

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:29.739
we don't want to have to be typing that over and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.905
over and even if the stack was already created,

00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:34.930
you have the situation where you have to do

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.510
update stack and type all the commands over and over,

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.919
so we're not going to do that.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.449
What I have here is a create stack script file that we're going to

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.619
use and all I need to do is parse the stack name,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.805
parse the file name of the template,

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:55.784
that's the file that we're editing,

00:02:55.784 --> 00:02:58.520
and parse a parameter file if any,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.955
which we're going to need here pretty soon and we're going to explain what that is.

00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:03.560
Now, when we're updating,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.960
I have a different script that the only difference is that it has update stack.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.610
Now, this is my simplified version of nice workflow.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.820
However, we could do a more elaborate one if you're a developer,

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.764
if you know Python or more advanced bash scripting,

00:03:25.764 --> 00:03:30.449
you could actually do an AWS CloudFormation

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.899
describe stack command which is going to show you whether a stack already exist.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.280
What that's going to help you is,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.655
hey I'm trying to re-run this CloudFormation where the my stack already exist.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.074
All I want to do is update it again.

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:46.739
Okay? In that situation,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.730
you could have an if statement bash script that would do,

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:54.634
if it doesn't exist do a create and if it exists already do an update.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:59.959
Okay? That would be a more elaborate workflow.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.015
As you can see you can go as automated as you want but for our purpose right now,

00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:08.759
this little two scripts are going to be sufficient.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.534
So again back to our diagram here,

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:18.699
let's see what the goal is for this lesson.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.060
We will not be creating web server,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.339
databases or any of that.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:28.629
What we're going to do is create the underlying infrastructure,

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.439
what I call the networking portion.

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.139
So in this case,

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.694
we're going to be building the VPCs,

00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:36.599
attaching the Internet gateway,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.504
the subnets the necessary routing for the subnets and so on.

00:04:40.504 --> 00:04:43.469
So let's get started.
