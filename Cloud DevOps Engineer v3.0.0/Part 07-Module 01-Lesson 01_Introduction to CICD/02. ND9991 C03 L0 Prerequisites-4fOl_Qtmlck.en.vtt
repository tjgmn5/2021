00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.980
I'm so glad you're here to learn about cloud development.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.650
The world needs people like you who are willing to give

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.515
up their valuable time and learn a new skill.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.895
Aspiring to be a cloud developer is certainly no small goal,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.625
but it will definitely be worth all the work.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.580
I really want you to succeed and there are few things you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.925
should already know how to do before you start this course.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.995
If you don't have these things mastered,

00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.920
you might struggle in my course and I would rather you set

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.535
yourself up for success as much as possible.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:36.040
I'll just run through the list quickly so you're aware.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.380
If you need to pause here and take some time to learn or re-learn something,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.025
no worries at all, I'll be right here when you get back.

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.225
Here's what you need to stay afloat in this course.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.415
Experience with front end development

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.610
using HTML and JavaScript, it's going to help a lot.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.870
Experience using version control using Git.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.165
Experience with back-end development of an application in AWS.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:04.535
Knowing how to use the Linux command line.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.495
The ability to create a key-pair from EC2.

00:01:08.495 --> 00:01:14.335
The ability to create an AWS IAM user with programmatic access.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:20.640
Being able to use PostgreSQL database in either AWS, RDS or locally.
