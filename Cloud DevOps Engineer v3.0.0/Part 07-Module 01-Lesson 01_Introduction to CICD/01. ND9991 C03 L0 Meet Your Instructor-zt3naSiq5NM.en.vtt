Hi, I'm Barron [inaudible] and I'm excited to be here with you to teach you about CI/CD,

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:10.440
and all the amazing things that come with it.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.960
I got an early start with computers.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.275
When I was a kid, my parents brought home a Commodore 64,

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.870
our first computer and video game system.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.715
The modern equivalent would be if dad brought home a new model of a PlayStation,

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:27.915
except that the C64 was more than just a video game console.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.760
It had the basic programming language,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.750
and came with a thick spiral bound book that taught the language.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.370
As soon as I could read,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.080
I started devouring that book and getting every bit of knowledge I could.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.675
My best friend had an Apple computer,

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.300
and we spent every weekend experimenting,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.955
programming, printing code, refactoring,

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:52.595
and building tons of useless games.

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.380
Well, not so useless,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.960
considering we're both still programmers and have

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.440
both built pretty good careers on our weekend playtime.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.620
Through the years, I've managed to keep up with the changes in

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.000
technology by trying to do my best to stay ahead of them.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.205
This usually makes me a bit of an early adopter.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:13.970
I don't typically mind the experimental nature of frameworks,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.440
and languages, and libraries,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.605
as long as I can eventually understand what's going on.

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:22.460
Until I discovered the concept of build and deployment automation,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.110
I did what everybody else did.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.885
I compiled locally, made a zip file,

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.225
uploaded it to some FTP server,

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:30.725
logged into the server,

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:33.105
unzipped it and configure the server.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:35.195
Funny. Now that I think of it,

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.360
that was one of the less complicated scenarios.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.100
Then IDEs like Eclipse and Visual Studio came along and tried their best

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.295
to abstract as programmers away from all the mess with publishing features.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:49.790
But it was still pretty much

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.020
the worst deployment experience I can imagine. But it was all we knew.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.130
I was an early adopter of continuous integration when JetBrains,

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.785
one of my favorite companies in the world,

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:04.020
came out with TeamCity in 2006.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.050
TeamCity is still one of the most popular commercial continuous integration servers.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.800
It transformed the team I was working on in ways that I and my teammates didn't expect.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.450
We were all so frustrated with one another.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.265
We were stepping on each other's work,

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.205
leaving broken test, the compile errors everywhere,

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:25.895
pushing deploy responsibility just off to one soul,

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.255
while the rest of us had nice weekends.

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:30.440
When we introduced CI to the mix,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.810
we started to act as a team.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.340
It's crazy how one piece of software can calm such as savage beast,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.434
as a raging team of software developers at each other's throats.

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:45.439
Since those days, I've seen this story repeat several times,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.350
and the rest of the world has caught up as you can tell.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.740
Nowadays, it's very odd to find a development team who

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.685
doesn't have a build server to unify them, enforce transparency.

00:02:55.685 --> 00:02:58.475
Speaking for me, and my clients, and my teams,

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:02.915
we don't write a single line of code until there is a CI server in place.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:06.965
With so many choices and so many advances to make things simpler,

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:09.960
there are no excuses.
