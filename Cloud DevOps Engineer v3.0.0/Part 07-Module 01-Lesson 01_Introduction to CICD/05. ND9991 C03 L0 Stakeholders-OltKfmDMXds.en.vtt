00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.190
I wanted to discuss with you a little bit about stakeholders.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.560
Maybe you weren't expecting to hear me talking

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.335
about stakeholders in a course about CI/CD,

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.135
but I think there's something here,

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:15.810
that you would be better off knowing and might even give you an edge in

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.760
your job if you have a little extra empathy for the decision-makers in your company.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.905
Since the beginning of time,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:26.235
or at least since the beginning of technology and business,

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:31.170
there has been a divide between non-technical stakeholders and technical staff.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.530
People on both sides of this divide

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.640
believe the other people don't understand what they do.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.455
Even if that's true, which it isn't always,

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:43.985
it doesn't mean both sides shouldn't try to come together on some common ground.

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:46.730
Technologists can help business leaders make

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.059
better decisions because of their knowledge of what's possible,

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.375
feasible, cost-effective, or otherwise.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:55.490
They might even have some creative ways to think about or

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.095
solve problems that non-technical people wouldn't normally consider.

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:02.510
On the other hand, business leaders are in the position they're in,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.150
because they too have a lot to offer.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.130
People with a business mindset often see strategy more quickly than technologists,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.165
who are more focused naturally on tactics.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:15.650
Also, there's incredible value in

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.490
the zoomed out big picture perspective that decision-makers have,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.670
that most technologists simply don't have access to.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.330
The scenario that I see so often is that the business side of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.635
the house tends to make decisions without seeking the wisdom from the tech side.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:33.230
They believe the tech side of the house might not be

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.810
qualified or interested in those decisions.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.100
Sometimes the results are not that great.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.740
On the other hand, I see a lot of technologists making decisions

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.520
on behalf of the business without the knowledge of decision-makers.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.070
They believe that non-technical people are not

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.020
qualified or interested in those decisions. Sound familiar?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.805
Like the other side, the results are not always that great.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.435
Here's my point, both sides of the divide,

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:04.160
need to involve the other side in decisions,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.960
so that our companies can be stronger and make a better impact on the world,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.980
but I'm not talking to the business side of the house, am I?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.775
No, I'm talking to you cloud developer.

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:16.635
It's got to start with you.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:22.640
Bring your business leaders into the discussion about CI/CD and continuous delivery,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.550
translate the technical terms into words

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.820
that matter to the business minded people in your company.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.290
Convince them to move in the direction of continuous delivery,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.230
based on the very real benefits it can have for your company.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.090
Get the decision-makers to make the decision.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.780
Then, you'll have the support of the stake holders to make real change.
