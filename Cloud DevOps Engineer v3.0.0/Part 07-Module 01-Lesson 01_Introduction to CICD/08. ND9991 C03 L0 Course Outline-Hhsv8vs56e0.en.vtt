00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.120
My goal isn't to teach you everything about CI/CD and monitoring.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.270
That would require way too much time and let's face it,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.535
you probably wouldn't retain all that information.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:16.140
What I will do, is attempt to give you enough awareness of

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.210
the core principles and lead you to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.200
practice a few of the most useful things in each area.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.030
In the time we have together,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.320
we're going to fill up your toolbox with some new and useful skills.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.200
My hope is to equip you well enough to start

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.480
using those skills even as early as next week.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.040
In this course, we'll talk a lot about the theory and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.630
principles behind continuous delivery, integration and deployment.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.579
Then, we'll put that theory to work as we discuss

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.120
and even build a complete CI pipeline from commit,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.360
to build, to artifact.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.820
Once we have CI running and artifacts building,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.150
we'll build out an entire CD pipeline,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.630
putting more of that theory to the test.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.970
Then, once we have CI and CD running,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.469
we'll spin up a monitoring system that can alert us when something fails.
