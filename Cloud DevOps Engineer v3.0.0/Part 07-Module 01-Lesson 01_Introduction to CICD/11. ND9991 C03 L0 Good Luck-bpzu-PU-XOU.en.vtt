00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.100
As you can see, there's a lot in store for you in this course.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.910
Don't be intimidated by the amount of ground we're going to cover.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.410
We'll take it one step at a time and give you plenty of checkpoints along the way,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.830
to check your understanding and correct course when needed.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.450
When you're finished, you'll have

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.565
some very valuable and needed skills to round you out as a Cloud developer.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.440
So buckle up, and sit back,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.635
raise your tray table and seat back to the upright position,

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:32.190
obey the lighted placards and instructions from crew members.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.470
This plane is cleared for takeoff.
