00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.165
Now that we've understood the broad parameters of how

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:11.580
to create the tasks templates system,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.749
the services control of ansible,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.180
let's look at how we actually run it.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.195
This is the execution of a playbook.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:25.440
Let's look at this in practice with an ansible inventory file.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.065
Here we are denoting different collections of servers.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.360
So first, we have web server,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.340
and we have a single host,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.895
IP addresses, ansible user,

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:42.090
and then the protocol which is used for connecting,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.790
and next we have a second group,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.430
db-server with two instances in it,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.295
and we notice that we have a different IP addresses here, so that's good.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:55.205
Everything else remains the same.

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:59.770
So now, for actually going about applying this,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.635
we are looking at a root level playbook,

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:09.605
and this is not actually gathering the facts which is

00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:15.655
what we looked at earlier when you are able to display all of the Linux,

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:19.295
or Unix, or Windows facts that are available on the system.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:23.180
But if you're in a security enhanced environment,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.935
you may not want to do that.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:35.205
So it is including the role here to do the init for postgres task.

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:39.340
Let's look at this a little deeper.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.320
Now, if we actually are going about running a playbook,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.190
we use the ansible playbook command,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.835
and here we are including an inventory with dash i,

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.730
and this inventory is called my_hosts,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.870
and we're setting a variable.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.335
So we do dash a and then the variable, SE-Linux equals true,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:11.490
and the root level playbook where we're running a init_servers.yamal will be executed.
