let's just go over what we've learned real fast.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.415
So we've covered templates,

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.835
how to configure a program,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.290
we've covered systemd, we've covered conditionals,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.815
we've also covered package installs.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:28.305
To wrap it all up, we did an inventory and looked at what a role encompasses.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.810
