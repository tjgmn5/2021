00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.965
Ansible services; starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:15.450
So these refer to the Linux means of managing how a service is run.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.200
When we're talking about enabling,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.245
that means that when the system restarts,

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:25.245
that service will start automagically.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.180
When we're talking about starting,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.710
we're just talking about in the temporal moment of now,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.730
of making that service run.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.005
But when the system restarts,

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.785
the service will not necessarily start again unless it's in enabled state.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:41.960
So these are important distinctions.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.045
We also need to pay attention to the daemon reload.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.310
The reason why this is important is,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.645
let's say we've installed a new program and it hasn't yet been registered by systemd.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:01.040
With daemon reload, we can cause it to take

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.960
those temporary state changes and put them into effect. This is very important.
