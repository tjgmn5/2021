Ansible templates.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.950
So a template is something that lets you abstract a file.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.019
What we mean by that is we want to be able to have most of the file be static,

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.469
but certain parts are changing for what we're concerned about

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.414
and those changes we have inside a double-quotes,

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:23.730
brackets, and then the variable name.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.815
So let's look at how this looks in an actual file.

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:37.920
So this here is a file to present a repo in the form of packages

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.454
and here we have been abstracted the server name

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:48.185
and the repo name and we can see that based on the double quotes and the squiggly lines.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:52.630
So let's look at how this actually works.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.895
With a template, you have the templated file but then you have to

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:07.295
apply that templated file to the system which is where this module template takes place.

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:12.590
In addition, you have the variables that are defined that go into that templated file.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.674
So you have three levels of depth.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:20.370
So here we're looking at the application of that template onto the system.
