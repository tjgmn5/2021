00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
So next subject, we have the topic of roles.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.495
A role is merely a collection of tasks that are designed to perform

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:18.780
some common activity and this may seem misleading,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.429
but when we say tasks,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.439
that also includes templates, vars and files.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.900
Ansible is very smart in the way that it lays out its directory structure.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.125
You have at the lowest level,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:41.774
your root level configurations and then you have a sub-directory roles,

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:46.250
and roles contains all of your differently named roles.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.975
They ought to be unique and each role contains its own tasks,

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:52.625
templates, vars, and files,

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.270
and so it makes organizationally things work pretty well.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.585
When you are in the process of working on a root level playbook,

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:07.519
you need to include roles and one of the means of doing

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:13.864
so is with a task and with the include role module.

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:21.004
So we have this here for a role that is creating the Vault Service,

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.750
which is a HashiCorp product.
