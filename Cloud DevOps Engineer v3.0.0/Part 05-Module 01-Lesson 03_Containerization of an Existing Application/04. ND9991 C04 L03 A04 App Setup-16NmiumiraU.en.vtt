00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
Now that we've been able to copy all the source code,

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.240
let's make sure that the app is actually able to be set up properly.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.890
So let's go ahead and look at this Dockerfile.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.714
Now, one of the most important parts of the app being able to run effectively,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:19.184
is knowing which port is actually going to be exposed from the container.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:23.924
So in this case, because we want this to run on port 80,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:27.525
I'm going to need to make sure that I actually run this,

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:32.030
expose the correct port externally so that my application can run.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.200
Really there's these two ports to think about.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.230
There's the port that the application itself would run

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.619
and then there's the port that's exposed to me on my host.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:45.219
So this is actually exposing the host port, which is port 80.
