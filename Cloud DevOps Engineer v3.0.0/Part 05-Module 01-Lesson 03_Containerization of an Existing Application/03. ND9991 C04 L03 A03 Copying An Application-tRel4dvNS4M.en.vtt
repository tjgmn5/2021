00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
Okay, now that we've been able to install packages,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.030
now let's look at what's involved in copying application.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.985
So if we go back to this docker file here,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.750
you can see that what I do is actually copy

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.940
the source code here directly into my working application.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.010
If you remember, one of the things that we also will need to do is,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
we'll also need to make sure that the plugins directory is also loaded.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.185
So let's go ahead and add another line here.

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:34.980
Will do this and we'll say nLib,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.925
and then we'll add that directly inside of the app directory as well.

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:47.180
So it's really important to make sure that not only do I copy the flask app itself,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.420
but also in copying any additional source code or modules that are necessary.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.690
You can see how you do that.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.600
You just add this copy command, and then you specify

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.640
the destination directory where it needs to live.
