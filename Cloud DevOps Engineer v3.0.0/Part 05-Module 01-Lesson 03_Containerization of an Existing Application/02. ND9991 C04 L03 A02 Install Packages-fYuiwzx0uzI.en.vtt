00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
Now that we know the basic structure about Docker,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:04.310
we've seen flask running.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's get into how to actually install the packages inside of this Docker file.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.370
So if we go back again to this Docker file,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.110
let's take a look at it,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.805
the part that installs the packages is this block right here.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:19.020
So what I do is I say,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.750
pip install --upgrade pip.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.360
So this is a great first step to make sure that I'm

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.660
using the latest version of pip inside my Docker container.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
Next, what I do, is actually go through here and I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.240
actually install the requirements that are inside this TXT file.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.415
So really that's all that's necessary is I say pip install and then I do -r requirements.

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:44.550
We've already seen what you do in there,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.165
you just add different Python packages

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:51.720
and then this will run when I build my Docker image.
