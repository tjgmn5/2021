00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.379
Okay, we're finished with building and containerizing this application,

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.779
and we've gone through quite a few steps.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.759
Let's go through and summarize those.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.509
First, we're able to look at a base Docker image

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.689
and use that to build out the rest of our application.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.864
Next, we went through and installed the packages by using the Docker file.

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.339
Then, we wanted to copy in the application,

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.975
so we took the Flask app,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.040
we took the plugins,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.989
we copied those packages,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.269
and we put them inside of our Docker container.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.429
Next, we went into app set up,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:37.064
and so we were able to actually make sure that the ports were the correct ports,

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:40.155
and the ports were connecting to our host application.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:42.215
Finally, we went to app start.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:44.310
This is a really important final step.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.840
What this does is, it verifies that when the container is built,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.955
it'll actually launch and run,

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:53.299
and it's ready to actually be deployed in a production environment.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.279
So it's a really important final step that really

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.759
is the last thing you should check off your list.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.710
Once you've done that, the final thing we did was we went to a web browser,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.945
and we verified that our application was running.

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:10.159
So this is really a pretty straightforward process once you get used to it,

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.899
and you can take what you've learned from this demo and apply it to your project.
