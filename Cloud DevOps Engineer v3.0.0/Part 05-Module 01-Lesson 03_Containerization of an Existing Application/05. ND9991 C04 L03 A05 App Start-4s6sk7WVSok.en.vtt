00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Okay. Now let's look at the app start itself.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.620
So not only do you need to go in and set up the base image,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.320
install things inside of their copy or source code,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.420
but you also need to be thinking about, "Well,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.780
what do I do when I run this Docker image?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.090
How do I make it automatically start the service that I actually want to talk to you?"

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.865
So let's go ahead and see how that works.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:28.350
So the way you do that is you go through and you create this command,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.860
and this command as it actually run at the very end of your Docker file.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.150
So we see here that this command is going to run the Python

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.200
interpreter that's inside of this base Docker image right here.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.315
We know it's going to be Python 3.7.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:45.720
Then we know that we've copied web.py

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.665
which is essentially at the root level of the directory.

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:53.030
So web.py will now start up automatically because we told

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.440
it explicitly to run at the very end of our Docker configurations.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.150
So this is a really important final step.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.250
It's only one line of code.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.950
But it's important to think about that if you're building something that's a service,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.270
you need to start the service at the very end of your Docker file configuration.
