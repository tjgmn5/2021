              "text": "# Directions for Completing your Project\n\n## A. AWS Steps\n1. Log in to the AWS management console, as a **Root user**. Find and select the IAM (Identify and Access Management) service.\n\n1. Click on \"Group\" menu item from the left sidebar. Create a new group and name it \"jenkins\", and attach the following policies: \n - AmazonEC2FullAccess\n - AmazonVPCFullAccess\n - AmazonS3FullAccess. \n\n1. Create an IAM user\n * Click on \"Users\" menu item from the left sidebar. Create a new IAM User, select \"Users\" from the left sidebar, then \"Add user,\" and use \"jenkins\" as the user name. Click on both \"programmatic access\" and \"AWS management console access.\" The defaults for auto-generated password and \"users must create a new password at next sign-in\" are OK and should be kept. Hit \"Next\", and add the \"jenkins\" user to the \"jenkins\" group. Hit \"next,\" no need to add \"Tags.\" Review, and accept. Capture the Access Key, Secret Access Key, and the password so that you can log in as IAM user in the next step. (easy to just download the csv file).\n\n * **Screenshot-01** - Go to IAM dashboard, as the root user. Click on \"Users\" menu item from the sidebar and select the user that you have just created from the displayed result. Click on the \"Permissions\" tab. **Please provide a screenshot of the AWS console with the permissions being created. Name this 'screenshot-01.'**\n * Copy the IAM User sign-in link from the IAM Dashboard.\n\n1. Sign in as the new IAM user in a new browser window.\n * First, sign out of the AWS console. Then, use the IAM User sign-in link copied from the previous step.\n * Alternatively, you can login as the root user. Go to IAM dashboard.  Click on \"Users\" menu item from the left sidebar. Select the 'jenkins' user link, and go to the Security credentials tab. Copy the \"Console sign-in link\". \n * If you haven't copied the IAM User sign-in link, you can generate the URL as follows:\n    * In the following syntax `https://<your_aws_account_id>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/`, replace the `<your_aws_account_id>` with your AWS account number without the hyphens (for example, if your AWS account number is 1234-5678-9012, your AWS account ID is 123456789012)\n\n\n5. Create a new key pair for access to your instance(s). Choose EC2 as the service after logging in. Select \"Key Pairs\" from the sidebar on the left, from the \"Network and Security\" section. Enter the \"pipeline\" name when prompted. Save the \".pem\" file.\n\tIf you will use an SSH client on a Mac or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it:\n\n\t`chmod 400 your_user_name-key-pair-region_name.pem`\n\n1. Launch the EC2 t2.micro for the free tier, pick \"Ubuntu 18.04 LTS amd64,\" review, and when hitting \"launch\" *ensure* that an existing pair (\"pipeline\") from before is selected. If you're not using the right key pair, you cannot log in. **Now, an Ubuntu 18.04 t2.micro instance is launched in the AWS EC2, that can be accessed via SSH using the PEM file. A screenshot showing the unique AWS URL of your EC2 instance should be captured. Name this 'screenshot-02.'**\n\n1. Once launched, create a security group for the vm. In the left sidebar, under Network and Security, select \"Security Groups.\"\n   Under name, use: 'jenkins', description: \"basic Jenkins security group,\" VPC should have the default one used.\n   Click Add Rule:\n   Custom TCP Rule, Protocol:\n   TCP, Port Range 8080, Source 0.0.0.0/0\n   Then add the SSH rule: Protocol: SSH, Port range: 22, From source, use the dropdown and select \"My IP.\"\n\n1. Go back to instances, and right-click the running instance, select Networking and change the security groups. Select the Jenkins security group that was created previously.\n\n1. To connect to your instance using your key pair, follow these steps. Right click your running instance and select \"Connect,\" then follow the instructions to SSH into it. For example, here are the directions that popped up in my AWS console on how to SSH into my machine (your directions will not look exactly like this, since portions of the information, like the full domain address of the instance, will be different):\n\n",

Next, append the Debian package repo address to the server's sources.list:\n\n\tsudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'\n\nWhen both of these are all set, run `update` so that `apt` will use the new repo:\n\n\tsudo apt update\n\nLastly, install Jenkins and its dependencies:\n\n\tsudo apt install jenkins\n\n\nSince `systemctl` doesn't produce output, you can use its `status` command to confirm that Jenkins began successfully:\n\n\tsudo systemctl status jenkins\n\n\nIf all went well, the first lines of the output will show that the service is active and configured to start at boot, as shown below:\n",
