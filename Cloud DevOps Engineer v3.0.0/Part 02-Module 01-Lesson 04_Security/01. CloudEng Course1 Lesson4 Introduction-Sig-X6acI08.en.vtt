00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Now, that you know how to organize and store the files that make up your website,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.790
you'll want to make sure that not only is your website secure,

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.509
but that the servers your website runs on are protected.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.109
In this lesson, I will teach you about security in the cloud,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.155
showing you how to protect your data and systems.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:22.289
I will also show you cloud security services that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.329
help you ensure that users are who they say they are,

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.609
and they only have access to the specific data they need,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.329
and not to everything.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.649
So let's get started.
