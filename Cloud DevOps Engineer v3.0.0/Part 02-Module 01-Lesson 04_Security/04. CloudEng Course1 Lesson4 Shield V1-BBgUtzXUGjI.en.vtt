AWS Shield is a managed DDoS or distributed denial of service,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.169
protection service, that safeguards web applications running on AWS.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.030
A distributed denial of service attack is an attempt to make a website or

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.970
an application unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.039
When a server is overwhelmed,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.000
it typically crashes and can no longer serve requests.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.670
An attack like this would leave your website or

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.525
web application unavailable which could result in a loss of revenue.

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:42.074
I mentioned that some Cloud security options depend on the vendor.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.520
Well, AWS Shield is a service that you get out of the box.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.680
It is always running automatically and as a part of the free standard tier.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.890
If you want to use more of the advanced features,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.079
you'll need to utilize the paid tier.
