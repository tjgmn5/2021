00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.980
Along with protecting data and systems,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.470
we also need to ensure that users are who they say they are,

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.695
and that they only have access to the specific data they need to and not to everything.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.414
This concept is called least privileged access.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:22.724
This is where the Identity and Access Management or IAM service helps out.

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:29.490
IAM is an AWS service that allows us to configure who can access our AWS account,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.780
services, or even applications running in our account.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.630
IAM is a global service and is automatically available across all regions.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.359
When you initially sign up for a free tier AWS account,

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.950
the e-mail address you used to sign up with becomes your root level account,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.420
and has full access and permissions to any and everything within your account.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.340
I cannot stress enough that you must secure your root account,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.359
and that you shouldn't use the root user credentials for everyday access.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.329
One way to secure your root account is by using Multi Factor Authentication or MFA.

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.030
Which will always require an additional form of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.820
authentication along with your password like,

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.709
a code sent to your cell phone,

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:20.949
or a code from a multi authentication app on your cell phone before logging you in.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.959
If you haven't secured your account in this manner,

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.335
stop this video right now and do it.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:31.929
There are several security concepts within IAM.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.550
An IAM user is an entity that you create an AWS to represent

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.189
the person or service that interacts with

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.000
services or applications running in your AWS account.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.060
A user in AWS consists of a username and access credentials like,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.715
a console password on access key,

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:56.950
which includes an access key ID and a secret access key.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.575
An IAM group is a collection of users.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:06.784
You can specify permissions for a collection which makes permissions easier to manage.

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:11.120
A role is an identity with permissions or a set of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.134
privileges that are not associated with a specific IAM user or IAM group.

00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:19.569
Roles can be attached to a user,

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.864
and a user can assume a single role temporarily to perform a specific task.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:29.090
A policy is a way to define

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.295
granular level permissions and can be attached to users, groups and roles.

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:39.559
AWS provides a pre-defined list of policies.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.854
Additionally, you can create your own custom policies using JSON.

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:48.969
This is an example of a custom policy that states,

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:54.199
"Everyone has access to an S3 bucket called mybucket".

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:59.304
EC2 security groups aren't technically a part of IAM.

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:02.810
New AWS users often confuse it with

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.224
an IAM security group but they are two totally different things.

00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:12.439
EC2 security groups are associated with an EC2 instance and act

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:18.050
as a built-in firewall for your virtual servers to either allow or deny access.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.670
We discussed EC2 security groups when we discussed security and EC2.
