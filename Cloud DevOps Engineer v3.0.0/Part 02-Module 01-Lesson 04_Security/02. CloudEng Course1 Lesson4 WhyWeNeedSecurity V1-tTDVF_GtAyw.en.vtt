00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.974
As adoption of Cloud services has increased,

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.605
so has the need for increased security in the Cloud.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:17.230
Stories about companies being hacked and data and security breaches are widespread.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.260
It is important for companies to secure their customers data,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.484
especially data that is considered to be PII or personally identifiable information.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.559
Such as, social security numbers,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.539
bank account information, passport numbers, etc.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.280
Along with protecting the data,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.954
it is important to protect the applications that provide access to that data.

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:46.214
The great thing about cloud security,

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:48.645
is that it not only protects the data,

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:52.850
it also protects applications that access the data,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.250
and it even protects the infrastructure like servers that the applications run on.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.450
The way security is delivered,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.520
depends on the Cloud provider you're using and the cloud security options they offer.
