00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.855
Now, let's see IAM in action.

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.599
So let's navigate to the IAM service.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.295
This dashboard shows you how many users and how many groups you have.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.199
Let's click on "Groups".

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.000
You can manage groups by creating new ones or deleting existing ones.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.129
There are several actions you can do with a group, like adding users,

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:31.500
deleting the group, changing the group name, removing users, etc.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.289
Now, let's click on "Roles".

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.539
This page shows all the roles in the system.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.204
Notice, some roles are related to services.

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:45.699
For example, let's look at the api-gateway-role.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.740
So any user or application assuming this role has full access to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.895
Lambda, CloudWatchLogs, and DynamoDBFullAccess.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.170
Now, let's look at a few policies.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.899
Click on "Policies" here on the left-hand side,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.215
and let's look at the Administrator policy.

00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:15.125
Notice, a policy is defined as JSON and notice everything is wide open.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:19.685
It allows any action on any resource.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:23.049
Let's look at a more restrictive policy.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.099
Go back and search for S3,

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:32.435
and click on "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess".

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:40.090
Notice, read-only allows you to get or list objects in a bucket.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.109
Let's go back and now let's look at AmazonS3FullAccess.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.260
Again, this allows any action on any resource.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.920
Now, let's review the security policy on a bucket.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.754
Policies can be attached to buckets.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:10.229
Let's navigate to S3 and look at our code VR Bucket.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.269
Click on "Permissions" and click on "Bucket Policy".

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.189
Notice on line eight,

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:23.210
it allows GetObject on everything here in the code VR bucket.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.034
You can of course make this more restrictive as we've seen.

00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:31.199
That's a look at Identity and Access Management.
