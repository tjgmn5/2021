AWS WAF or AWS Web Application Firewall

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.799
provides a firewall that protects your web applications.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.910
A firewall is a network security mechanism that monitors and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.384
controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on preset security rules.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:25.929
A firewall stands in front of your application as a way to guard who can access it.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.350
The rules that you set up inside of your firewall allows certain traffic or block it.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.335
Firewalls are largely used to protect your web applications from unintended access.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:43.710
WAF can stop common web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.820
etc by reviewing the data being sent to your application and stopping well-known attacks.
