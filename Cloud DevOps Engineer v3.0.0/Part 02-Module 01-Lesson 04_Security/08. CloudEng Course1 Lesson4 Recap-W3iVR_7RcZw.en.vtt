00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.679
In this lesson, I introduced you to security in the cloud.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:10.169
I showed you how to safeguard your web applications running on AWS using Shield.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.785
Shield is the perfect service to stop a DDoS attack.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:19.850
Next, I taught you about a firewall service to protect your web applications called WAF.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.700
Don't forget that a firewall stands in front of

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.210
your application as a way to guard who can access it.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.275
We wrapped up with IAM,

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:30.299
identity and access management;

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.960
an AWS service that allows you to configure who can access your AWS account,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.530
services, and applications running in your account.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.340
Next, I will teach you about networking and elasticity.
