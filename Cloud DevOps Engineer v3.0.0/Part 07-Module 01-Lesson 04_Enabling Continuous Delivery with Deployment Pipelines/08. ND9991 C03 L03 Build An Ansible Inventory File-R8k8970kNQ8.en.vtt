00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.050
The inventory file in Ansible is a powerful way to manage and query server instances,

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.805
especially if you have a lot.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:15.420
After all, one of the really cool things about Ansible is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.005
that you can make changes to 1,000 servers at a time,

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.875
like my previous example.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.225
But let's bring it back down to CICD.

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:29.385
When we're deploying, we're not typically configuring 1,000 servers at once,

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.075
it might be only one or a handful.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.440
Why do we need an inventory file for so few?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.720
Well, it just so happens that the inventory file is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.790
a really easy way to target instances even if they're unknown until now,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.365
as is the case when you're provisioning new servers on the fly.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:51.320
Since the inventory file is only a simple text file,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.160
we can do some clever scripting and get a list of instances from

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.870
AWS and append them to the end of our inventory file.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.760
Then when we execute our playbook against our inventory file,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.060
our dynamic instances get configured as they should.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.555
I'm going to run a simple AWS command that queries

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:16.450
the public IP addresses of my instances in AWS,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.730
aws ec2 describe-instances, that's going to get

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.570
all of the instances and we're specifically querying the public IP address.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.930
As you can see here, I only have one instance, and that's true.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.595
How did we get that instance into an inventory file?

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:37.865
Well, we could just pipe that into a file like an inventory file,

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:43.585
but we need to have our header above the IP address so that it works for our playbook.

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:47.285
Let's add an inventory file first and then allow

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:52.110
AWS to append to the IP address to our inventory file.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.080
So there I've got an inventory file,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.685
it has all at the top,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:02.630
and so now let's rerun our AWS command

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.410
and actually pipe that out to our inventory file as well.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.830
Done. Let's take a look.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.300
Excellent. So now we have an inventory file with

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.795
our all header and it includes our IP address for our instance in AWS.

00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:23.480
So now your task is to wrap this process up in

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.070
a CICD job so that it's available to us at time of deployment.
