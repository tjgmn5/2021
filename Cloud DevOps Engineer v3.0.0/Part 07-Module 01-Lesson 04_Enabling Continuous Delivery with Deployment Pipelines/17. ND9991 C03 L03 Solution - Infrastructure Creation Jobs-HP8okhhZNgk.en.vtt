00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.160
The things you've been learning in past courses and lessons are

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.055
really starting to come together in an exercise like this one,

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.770
you can now automate the creation of infrastructure.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.560
That's exciting, take a look at my code below and see how close yours was to mine.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.395
Notice what things you did and I did differently.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.900
Did you miss anything?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.210
Maybe go back and try a few things.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.665
Oh, and don't forget to clean up your EC2 instances to avoid those charges from AWS.

00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:33.860
Some things that might be interesting to point out are that we're using

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.840
this docker instance that has AWS CLI already installed for us.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.880
Then of course we're just checking out the code and running

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.510
our CloudFormation command to lift up that stack.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.475
There's really not much to it,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:55.020
we're really just wrapping our CloudFormation command in a job.
