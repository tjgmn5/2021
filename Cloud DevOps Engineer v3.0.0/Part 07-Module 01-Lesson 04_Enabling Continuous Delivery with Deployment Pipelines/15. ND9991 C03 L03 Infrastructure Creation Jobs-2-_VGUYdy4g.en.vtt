00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.090
Imagine we are running a build in CircleCI right now.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.390
All the previous code related jobs have completed and

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.510
the job runner is headed our way with artifact in hand.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.260
For blue-green deployment, we want to build up

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.860
a second version of production and later switch from old to new,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.615
from blue to green,

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:24.585
using a switching mechanism called a router.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.400
The goal is production,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.830
so what do we need to do next?

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.840
We don't have our infrastructure yet,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.030
so it looks like that's next up.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.260
Infrastructure creation jobs are meant to spin up new resources in AWS,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.025
that will later get configured,

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.225
deployed to, tested and promoted to production.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:46.940
We don't need a lot in this job because we should already have the cloud

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.235
formation templates to build up the necessary AWS resources.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.170
Really, all this job needs are things like,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.230
AWS credentials saved in your project environment

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.820
variables so that they're available for the AWS CLI.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.965
An image that has the AWS CLI pre-installed.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:09.385
A filter to only run this job on master branch.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:13.100
To check out the code and we need a step to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.640
actually execute that cloud formation with our template.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.290
Let's take a look at some code.
