00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.415
This is it. We've got our green production version humming,

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:07.035
smoke tests have passed,

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.500
confidence is high, it's time to make the switch.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.900
Let's think about what this job needs.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.209
I'm pretty sure it has the usual suspects,

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.880
a docker image and some steps.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.270
But there's something more that we need to pay attention to.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.350
This is actually a common problem that we have to solve from time to time.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.890
Remember, the jobs are all isolated and they're not aware of each other.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.455
We want the infrastructure as code to make the switch.

00:00:33.455 --> 00:00:36.590
But to do that, we have to have a way to communicate with

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.115
our router and reference the new green version.

00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:43.760
The way I typically do this is by tagging or naming

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.185
the green infrastructure with some ID that is unique to the pipeline,

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.635
but that the isolated jobs can all access.

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.090
In the case of CircleCI,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.810
we have the CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ ID environment variable.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
But we have to do this much earlier in the process

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.510
when we create the infrastructure in the first place.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.000
That way we can use cloud formation to tell

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.090
the router to direct to our traffic to the new version,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.150
whose name includes CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ ID.
