00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.000
You made it. Let's take a look at my solution together to see

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.270
if there are any differences between yours and mine.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.340
Here I have my main YAML,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.060
the playbook file, super short, super clean.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.815
I named it exercise.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.000
I want it to actually run on my local host,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.730
so I'm naming that directly without using an inventory file and I have a print role.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.975
If I go down into this print role tasks,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.060
I'll be able to see our role code,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.335
which only has two of these plays in it.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:39.770
One is to print the environment variable and the other is to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.610
actually expose it from the Ansible command line,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.185
which is usually invisible to us,

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:46.940
to our standard out.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.840
That's pretty much it. How did you do?

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.230
Using the same skills you just learned and put to use in this exercise,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.510
you can now control and configure countless machines reliably and consistently.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.510
You've now got an army of remote control SSH robots at your command

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.980
and you know how to keep your playbook code clean and maintainable using roles.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.525
This is a big step.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:14.129
Let's move on to the next.
