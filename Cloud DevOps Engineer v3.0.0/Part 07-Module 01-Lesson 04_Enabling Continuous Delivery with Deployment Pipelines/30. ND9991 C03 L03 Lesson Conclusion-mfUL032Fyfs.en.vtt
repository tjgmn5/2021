00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.545
That was quite a journey.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.695
We've covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time,

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:11.865
but I hope the practice that we did help to solidify the new knowledge.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.240
To recap, by now,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.175
you know what configuration management tools are and how to use them.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.815
You can design an Ansible Playbook.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.075
You can control remote machines using Ansible.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:25.165
You can build an inventory file,

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:29.705
and you can make various types of CD jobs in our CI/CD pipeline,

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:33.790
like creating infrastructure, deploying, smoke testing, rollbacks.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.830
We had a lot of fun in this lesson,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.150
turning our manual commands and scripts into automated code that runs on every commit.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.300
Now that we have production environments tested and running,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.690
it's time to start monitoring. Let's roll.
