00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.030
We've got one more step in the process of building confidence.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.965
When, not if, but when you have a bad deployment,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.310
you need to be able to restore production quickly.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.600
The speed at which you can respond to an incident will have more impact

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.995
on the confidence than whether or not the incident happened in the first place.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.365
For normal blue-green deployments,

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:30.705
the rollback is simply switching the traffic back to the old production version.

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:33.450
This might be the route you take in this job,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.110
or maybe you haven't promoted the green version at all and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.825
all you have to do is destroy the green instances and infrastructure.

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:43.880
In this case, production had no downtime at all and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.155
rollback is more about keeping costs low,

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:50.060
or maybe you're using another deployment strategy and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.075
rollback is a bit more complicated or time consuming.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.910
In this case, every second counts.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.890
So it's critical that the rollback is automated and optimized.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.865
Let's take a look at the second scenario,

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:07.700
where our smoke test failed and now we want to destroy our green version,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.180
the one that almost became the new production version.
