00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.480
Now our new version or our green version is running and configured,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.935
and ready for action.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.845
But we're not quite ready to make the big switch yet.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.860
Remember, one of the things I said we need to pull off for

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.995
true continuous delivery is confidence.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.220
Confidence on the part of the decision-makers in your company.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.030
Earlier, we said that one way to build confidence is to perform

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.035
smoke tests or spot checks to make sure that things are still working in general.

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:32.990
This might be hitting a couple of endpoints that query a database or

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.060
a third party service just to make sure that things are

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.340
still wired up, just as an example.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.910
A lot of smoke tests can be automated and still build a lot of confidence.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.554
Another word about confidence,

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:46.415
this doesn't happen overnight.

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:48.785
You got to build trust over time.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.335
As they say, trust is earned.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:55.190
One way to earn trust is to make sure that you're tracking metrics,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.765
like I mentioned before.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.615
With a history of success and data in hand,

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:04.765
you'll be able to convince decision-makers to allow less and less manual steps.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.760
I hope you're starting to see a pattern unfold here with our CI/CD jobs.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.900
They all have something in common.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.940
A Docker image where the job will run,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.875
SSH keys if needed,

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.765
some lines of shell script,

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:21.430
and a place in the order of the workflow.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.845
If you were to build a job that runs some smoke tests,

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:28.140
what would you need to include in that job code?
