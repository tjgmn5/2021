00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.005
Welcome to my code editor.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.290
This is our playbook that we're seeing right here.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.710
We can see in the folder structure,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.325
it's at the root, it's called main.yml.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:14.730
It's really simple, it only has a few lines of code.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.174
At the very top, we have hosts.

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:20.110
I'll tell you in just a moment what that web refers to,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.660
but we're basically saying,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.140
perform this Ansible playbook on all machines that are designated web.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.970
Also, our user is root user of the machine that we want to use.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.650
So ec2-user is what we're using for our Amazon Linux instance.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.525
Become actually helps us to escalate privileges like pseudo.

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:47.750
Then roles is a list of these encapsulated,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.340
more maintainable chunks of code that are in another place.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.420
So pay attention, here I've got web.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.220
Let's take a look at inventory.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.980
You remember before I created

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.870
an inventory file or I added my host name to an inventory file.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.065
We have here, this is typical INI format.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.240
We have here a heading for web.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.110
That means that every host name or IP address that comes

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.150
below this heading is going to be grouped into the web groups.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.250
If I have multiple host names or IP addresses here,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.665
it will actually run this Ansible playbook against all of them simultaneously.

00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:27.845
Also back in the playbook,

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:31.855
you remember that I have a role here, it's called Prometheus.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:35.690
This word corresponds with a name of a folder.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.300
This is convention over configuration.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.375
We have a name of a folder that corresponds with the name of the role.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:43.940
If I go into that folder,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.595
I have two folders inside of that,

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:49.315
I've got files and I've got tasks.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:54.755
My files has a Prometheus service and a Prometheus configuration yml file,

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:57.920
which will get copied in to the server later on.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.520
Here's the actual guts of this role.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.305
Everything that's inside of the tasks,

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:07.370
main.yml is the role of Prometheus.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.120
We can see here that it's updating the yum repository.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.870
It is adding a user or downloading a file, or extracting something.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350
We're moving files around,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.380
we are going to move some more files around.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.945
We're preparing a database directory.

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:25.745
The list goes on and on.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.490
All of these things are things that you would have to do manually,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.030
but the Ansible playbook is going to run them for us.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.395
At the very end,

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:36.410
it's going to restart the Prometheus service so that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.835
it actually will run when the system is rebooted.

00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:44.290
That's the basic anatomy of a playbook with roles.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.615
You're also probably noticing in my code that we're not

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.050
just calling shell scripts and executing bash commands.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.060
While it is possible just to use a bunch of shell commands to get the job done,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.965
Ansible offers these things called

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:02.060
modules that provide more maintainable, cleaner shortcuts.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.645
Things like apt and mpm for installing packages,

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:07.790
git for pushing and pulling,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.640
copy and unarchive to deal with files,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.855
and systemd for stopping and starting services.

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:17.000
I included a list of several that I think are useful,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.290
down below the video.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.810
There's also a link to see the complete list.
