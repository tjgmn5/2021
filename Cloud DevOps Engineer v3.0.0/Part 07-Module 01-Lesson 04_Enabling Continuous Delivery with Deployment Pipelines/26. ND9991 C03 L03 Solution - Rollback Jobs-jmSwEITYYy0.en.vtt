00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.770
This one's different from normal jobs.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.180
We use to command here,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.330
which is just like a reusable job in CircleCI.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.245
Take a look at my code, see how different yours was from mine.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.210
Notice my command is just like a job,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.890
but we can call it just like a function.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.200
We're using the qualifier when

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.255
on_fail to run our command only when something has gone wrong.

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:28.955
This contingency is another piece in the trust-building puzzle.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:32.270
Issues will arise, builds will fail.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.750
You're not going to be judged necessarily on how often you fail,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.950
but on how quickly and gracefully you react when failures happen,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.190
make sure you always set up your CI/CD pipelines to fail and recover with grace.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.545
If you struggled with this exercise,

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.720
the infrastructure creation section and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.390
the rollback jobs sections will be useful to review.
