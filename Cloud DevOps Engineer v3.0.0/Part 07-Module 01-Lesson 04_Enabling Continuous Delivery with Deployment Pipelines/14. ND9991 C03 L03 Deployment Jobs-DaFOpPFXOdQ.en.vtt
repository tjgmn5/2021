00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.930
The last few pages and exercises of the lesson have been all about Ansible.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.520
By now you should have enough of a foundation to put it to use and combine

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.350
that knowledge with what we know about CI/CD and CircleCI jobs.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.990
The next few sections we're going to go over some of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.205
the different types of jobs that you might need to run in a CD pipeline,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:25.515
we'll look at each type in detail.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:29.490
When we're done, you'll be able to build your own CI/CD servers

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.230
that can turn code into cash from first commit to production.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670
To get the most out of these next sections I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.605
suggest you code along with me and try things out for yourself.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:47.240
If you don't already have a playground repository and corresponding project in CircleCI,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.435
I suggest you get that set up before you continue.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:55.020
Ready? Let's start deploying.
