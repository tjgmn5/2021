00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.155
Great job. You made it.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:05.760
How exciting is that?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.040
You added a line to a text file?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.055
Yeah, this might seem like over-engineering right now,

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.780
but trust me, we're shooting for full automation here.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.125
It's just the beginning,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.780
but it's a beginning that won't need much attention later on.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.870
This kind of automation is essential when you're dealing with unknowns like

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.560
host names and IP addresses of instances that haven't even been created yet.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.855
This small step will help you gather that missing information.

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:35.899
Thank goodness we have tools like Bash and AWS CLI,

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.025
and EC2 tags to help surface that information.

00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:41.855
If you're a little confused about how we reached my solution,

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.525
it would be helpful to re-watch the previous video,

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:48.720
where we learned about how to build an Ansible inventory file.
