00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.510
When you started this exercise,

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.305
maybe you thought you would be doing more with Ansible,

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.465
but the Ansible file is already written.

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:13.920
Remember, jobs in CI/CD are just wrappers around the execution of tools.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
Take a look at my code here and see how close yours was to mine.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
It may look familiar because it's the same code from the demo before.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.560
We had to deal with a few things like Docker image,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.335
configuring the job to execute Ansible,

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:32.010
adding SSH keys using that fingerprint that we had to go and get,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.680
all to make it possible for Ansible to do its job.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.540
That's a pattern you'll notice over and over when we build jobs.
