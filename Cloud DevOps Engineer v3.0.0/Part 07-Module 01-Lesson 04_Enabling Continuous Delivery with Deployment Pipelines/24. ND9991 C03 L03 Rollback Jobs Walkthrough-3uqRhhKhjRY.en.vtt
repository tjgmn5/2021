00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.770
Here's my code for the rollback.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.325
I'll start at the very top and work my way down.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.760
In my configuration, I'm using a command because I want

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.240
to reuse this to destroy environment over and over.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.880
There may be several jobs that need to be able to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.450
destroy an environment as a result of some failure somewhere.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.440
I'm defining my command here by using this destroy environment name.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.510
I could have chosen any name at all,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.605
but I decided destroy environment was most descriptive in this case.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.210
It has its own steps,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.845
which only has one,

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:38.180
where we run the CloudFormation delete

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.050
stack command to delete a stack that we have already created.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.335
This is just going to keep the cost down.

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.445
Then in my job section,

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.280
I have a smoke test job.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.785
This is one example of a job that might fail and then cause me to want to revert,

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.175
or roll something back, or delete a stack.

00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:01.460
So my smoke test has just a regular Docker image.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.039
It could have been almost anything because in this case,

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.050
after I check out,

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.530
I'm actually going to run a simulate error step.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.365
So when I return one non-zero,

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:15.650
I'm simulating the error to cause the job to fail.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.200
When this step right here fails,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.910
then it will actually notice this one.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.580
Now, you see when I highlight this,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.100
it highlights this up here.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.895
It's because this is referencing the command that's up here.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:31.530
I'm using when on fail right here,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.465
so that this step,

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:39.845
this command, only executes when some step in the job has failed before this one.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:43.280
This is something that I can use over and over again in all of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.650
my deployment jobs where I may need to destroy the environment or rollback.
