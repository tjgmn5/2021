00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.810
Let's actually go back to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.375
our infrastructure creation job and make it apply a more reusable name to our stack.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:15.280
We'll use the circle workflow ID to make the stack name unique to the pipeline.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.260
That's all there is to it.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.555
Now when this job actually runs,

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:26.950
it will paste that workflow ID right on the end of our stack name.
