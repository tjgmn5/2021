00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.470
Promoting to production can be one of the easiest but scariest things we do in CI/CD.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.535
Well, it's scary if we haven't done enough testing and confidence building.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:16.520
But if you build your CI/CD pipeline to fail fast and build confidence along the way,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.300
then promoting to production should become so commonplace that it gets taken for granted.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.330
Take a look at my code here.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.135
What was the difference between mine and yours?

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.445
Probably not a lot by now, I mean,

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:33.420
this job is not much different from the others that we've seen.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.180
You probably starting to notice a common thread,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.335
CI/CD jobs basically provide an environment and then wrap some statements.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:46.180
Then it's the job of the other tools to actually do the hard work.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.040
Here in my code, I'm showing a job that is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.085
creating and deploying a frontend instead of a backend.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.650
The process is still pretty similar.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.915
I'm naming things using the circle workflow ID because it's just extremely convenient.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:03.325
I've got two steps in this job.

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:07.515
One is going to use cloudformation to deploy an s3 bucket,

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:11.630
and the other is going to actually interface directly with s3 to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.340
synchronize the files between local and my bucket.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.260
The second job is going to actually promote the version to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.515
production by running another cloudformation template

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.600
that is going to interact with cloudfront,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.920
my CDN, and change its target from the old bucket to the new bucket.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.895
Again, I'm using this circle workflow ID environment variable

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:40.020
to keep things referenceable and unique for this pipeline.
