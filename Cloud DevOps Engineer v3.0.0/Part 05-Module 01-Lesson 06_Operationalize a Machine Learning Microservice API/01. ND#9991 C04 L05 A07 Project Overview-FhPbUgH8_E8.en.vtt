00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Okay. Let's talk about this project now.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.635
So what's really fascinating about

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:06.960
the world of machine learning and data science right now,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.780
is that there's a lot of emphasis on building things for cargo or

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.620
opening up a statistics textbook and looking at linear regression or logistic regression.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.830
But what there's a lot less of is,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.570
are there people that know how to take that serialized model and deploy it to production?

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.510
So that's what this project is really about is,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.759
can you as a DevOps professional,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
work with the data science team and take their models and deploy it to production?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.795
So we built out a Flask application.

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:43.580
That flask application is going to take payloads that are going

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.585
to be payloads that will be able to predict some given solution.

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:49.790
Once the prediction is in place,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.390
it's then containerized using Docker and Kubernetes.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.010
So it allows us to build

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.740
a completely scalable machine learning service that's available via Flask API.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.620
So it's your job to go through and make sure that you put

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.565
the final touches on this machine learning application,

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:09.890
that you can also call yourself a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.340
machine learning operations professional as well as a DevOps professionals.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.470
So good luck, and I know you'll be successful.
