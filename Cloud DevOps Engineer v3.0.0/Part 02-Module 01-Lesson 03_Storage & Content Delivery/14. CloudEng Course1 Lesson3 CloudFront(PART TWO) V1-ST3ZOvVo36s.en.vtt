00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's see CloudFront in action.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.304
In a previous lesson,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.514
I reviewed the code for this VR static website,

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:10.259
and it's hosted from an S3 bucket.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.869
Image files, and other static content for

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.759
that website can be stored at an edge location using CloudFront.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.730
Let's navigate to the CloudFront Console.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.875
It is very simple to set up

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:32.990
a CloudFront distribution for the files found in that S3 bucket.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.855
So to do that,

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.304
you simply click "Create distribution".

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.969
Let me walk you through a distribution that I've already created.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.164
Click on it, and click on "Distribution settings."

00:00:44.164 --> 00:00:49.250
This general tab provides very high level information about the distribution.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.250
Here we see the status that it's deployed.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.740
We see the state that it's enabled.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.685
Let's look more closely at some of the more important tabs.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:01.690
Click on "Origins and Origin groups".

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:07.689
This shows the origin or the source for the files stored at the edge location.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.230
Notice here the origin type is S3.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.060
Another neat feature of CloudFront can be found on the restrictions tab.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.019
You can prevent IP addresses from certain countries from accessing the website.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:26.224
This means that CloudFront can also be used as a security mechanism.

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:30.004
The invalidations tab is also important.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.329
If you ever need to explore content from

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.450
the cache outside of the normal schedule you've set,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.920
you would click on the "Create invalidation" button.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.250
In your hands-on exercise,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.620
you'll have the opportunity to create your very own CloudFront distribution.
