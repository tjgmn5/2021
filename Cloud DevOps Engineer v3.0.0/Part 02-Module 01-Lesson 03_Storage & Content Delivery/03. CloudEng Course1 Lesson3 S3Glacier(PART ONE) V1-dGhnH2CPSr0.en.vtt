00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.039
Amazon Simple Storage Service or S3 is an object storage system in the Cloud.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.814
Think of it like a file system in the Cloud where you load files such as text documents,

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.320
image files, HTML files,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.750
whatever you need to store.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.449
When you upload a file to S3,

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.294
it gets a unique URL that can then be used to access it.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:31.250
All objects or files are stored in what's called a bucket,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.640
and one bucket can hold millions of objects.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.369
S3 buckets live in a region,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.324
but bucket names must be globally unique.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:46.700
S3 is designed for durability of 99.99s of objects across

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.395
multiple availability zones and 99.99 availability over a given year.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:58.640
Wow, that is excellent durability and availability.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.389
There are several use cases for S3,

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.895
hosting static websites, content delivery,

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:11.564
backup and recovery, archiving and big data,

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:16.030
application data, and hybrid cloud storage.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.700
There are several S3 storage classes.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.495
Storage classes are essentially different data access levels

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.195
for your data at certain price points.

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:31.759
One storage class called S3 Glacier is more for data archiving purposes,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.094
and you should place data there that you don't intend to access frequently.

00:01:36.094 --> 00:01:39.590
Glacier is cheaper than the S3 standard class,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.765
but data retrieval can be a few minutes up to hours.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:48.500
So when would you want to use Glacier over the S3 standard class?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.420
Suppose you have an application that generates a lot of log files every month,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.219
and for audit purposes,

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.439
you need to keep those files around.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.469
You don't intend to access those files often,

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.670
but they do need to be made available once a year to the auditors.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.430
Glacier would be the perfect place to preserve

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.909
those files since they would be infrequently accessed.
