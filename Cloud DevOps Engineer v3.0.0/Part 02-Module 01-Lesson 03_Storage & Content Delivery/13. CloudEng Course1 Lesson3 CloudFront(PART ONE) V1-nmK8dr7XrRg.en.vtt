CloudFront is Amazon service for content delivery.

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:10.230
CloudFront speeds up the delivery of your content through

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.990
Amazon's worldwide network of many data centers called edge locations.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.695
As in a typical content delivery network,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.310
your content is cached or stored for a certain period of

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.824
time at an edge location that is close to the user.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:32.429
When a user requests your website or other web content,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.144
the edge location is consulted first.

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:37.120
If the content is not there,

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:41.359
then your content is pulled from the origin or the original source,

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.494
which may be far away from the user's location,

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:49.804
then it's stored at the edge location and then delivered to your users.

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:53.299
All subsequent requests should now be faster because

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.244
the content is now stored at the edge location.

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:02.704
You can configure how long an item remains cached before a refresh,

00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:06.829
or you can manually expire or remove content from the cache,

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.420
should it need to be changed.
