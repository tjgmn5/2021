00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
Now that you have your server,

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:04.155
you'll need a logical method for

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:07.440
organizing and storing the files that make up your website.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.820
You may even want to pull data from a database for display on your site,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.509
and as you consider high availability and high performance,

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.789
you may even want to speed up the delivery of

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.765
your site by caching large image files or videos.

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:24.620
In this lesson, I will teach you about storage in

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.490
the cloud and show you how to organize and store your files.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.364
Next, I will show you how to process transactions in a relational database.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:39.965
I will also introduce you to the concept of a data warehouse and even in NoSQL database.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:42.365
We will wrap up with me showing you how to use

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:46.969
a content delivery network to speed up the delivery of your website.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.619
So let's get started.
