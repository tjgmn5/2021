00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.799
Redshift is a Cloud Data Warehousing Service to help companies manage big Data or

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.039
an extremely large volume of Data that needs to be

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.329
analyzed or reported against and quickly scale.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.469
Redshift is a managed service that allows you to run

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.824
fast Queries against your data using SQL or Standard Query Language.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.574
ETL or extract transform load tools,

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:32.070
and BI or Business Intelligence tools.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
Redshift also automates administrative and maintenance task.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.365
A Data Warehouse is designed for fast Query and Analysis not transaction processing,

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:49.145
and usually contains historical Data from transactional systems.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.720
For example, let's say you manage

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.609
your website that allows users to order products online.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.835
The more recent transactions,

00:00:57.835 --> 00:00:59.855
like the orders for the current year,

00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:03.094
may live in a Relational Database like Oracle,

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:07.314
because you may need to access them during day-to-day operations.

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:14.134
But orders from, let say 10 years ago maybe archived to a Data Warehouse like Redshift.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:17.525
Redshift stores data in a column format

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:21.250
as opposed to a row store like a relational database.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.930
This aids in fast query and analysis.
