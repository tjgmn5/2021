00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.410
Companies today need to collect, store,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.539
and analyze the data they've collected over the years at a massive scale.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.210
Storage services in the cloud provide a place for companies to store data providing

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.615
several benefits like durability, availability, and scalability.

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:30.379
Durability guarantees that you will not lose the data that you upload to the cloud.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:36.004
High durability gives you the peace of mind that your data will be there in the future.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.355
Availability addresses how quickly you can access your data.

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:46.444
High availability provides fast and reliable access to the data you stored in the cloud.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.670
Scalability allows applications running in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.910
your environment to always meet demand seamlessly.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.849
By adding or removing the resources

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.155
necessary to maintain steady-state and fast response times.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.520
There are three types of scaling.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.840
Vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, and diagonal scaling.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.210
Vertical scaling or scaling up is where you modify your server to meet demands.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:19.819
An example of this would be adding more memory or capacity to a single server.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.269
Horizontal scaling or scaling out is where you add or remove servers to meet demands.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:31.849
You may start out with two servers and end up with six servers to support demand.

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.149
Diagonals scaling is a combination of

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.800
horizontal and vertical scaling and offers maximum flexibility.
