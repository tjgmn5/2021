00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.785
Most applications need to process or store data for later use.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.530
Relational databases like Oracle,

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:15.209
Postgres, MySQL etc, serve this purpose.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.280
However, database administration is hard, and time-consuming,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.370
and often requires specialized skills,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.910
or if you don't have a specialists it takes time away from

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.304
developers responsible for building applications.

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:37.590
Database administrative task include; upgrades, patching,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.760
installs, backups, monitoring, performance checks, and security, etc.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.660
RDS or the relational database service,

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.759
is a service that aids in the administration and management of databases.

00:00:55.759 --> 00:01:00.530
RDS essentially sits on top of your database to help you manage

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.210
your database by automating time-consuming administrative task.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.299
Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQL Server.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.429
RDS even supports Amazon's proprietary relational database engine,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.600
Aurora which supports MySQL and Postgres.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.504
RDS provides features like fail over and backups, restoration and encryption,

00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:39.984
security and monitoring, data replication,

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:44.849
