00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.929
A Content Delivery Network or CDN,

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:12.404
speeds up delivery of your static and dynamic web content such as web-pages,

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:17.804
cascading style sheets, JavaScript logic, and images.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:23.370
Typically, content is cached or stored for a certain period of time,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.539
and when a user requests your website or other web content,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.179
content is pulled from the cache speeding up

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.179
the delivery of the content to your end users.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.385
A CDN reduces latency and decreases the load on your servers,

00:00:40.384 --> 00:00:43.159
which provides a good end user experience to

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.299
your customers and users of your applications.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.594
Latency simply means the time it takes to respond to a request.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.490
So from the time a user attempts to access

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.240
your website to the time it takes for your website to load.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.900
High latency causes your website to take a long time to

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.265
load while low latency causes your website to load quickly.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:12.510
Low latency is a good thing and CDNs assist with this.
