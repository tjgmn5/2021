00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.009
NoSQL databases are taking the world by storm.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.785
DynamoDB is one such database,

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:16.454
and it fits well with modern day server-less web applications, micro-services,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:21.089
gaming, IoT data, and mobile back-ends that need to quickly

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.504
scale and handle large amounts of data or millions of requests per second.

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:32.354
Traditional databases like Oracle don't handle this type of load or scale that well.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.934
So how is this possible?

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:41.350
Unlike traditional databases, NoSQL databases are considered to be Schema less.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.375
Schema less simply means,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:47.840
that the database doesn't contain a fixed or rigid data structure,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.390
and can easily change on the fly,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.625
based on the data being passed in.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.109
This offers great flexibility.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.524
Additionally, data is stored in JSON or JSON like text.

00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:08.549
JSON is simple text representing data in key value pairs.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.599
Each row or a record,

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:16.769
in a DynamoDB table is called a document.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:22.155
DynamoDB is a fully managed service, offered by AWS.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:26.210
Meaning you don't have to worry about provisioning or managing servers,

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.349
or patching or upgrading your databases.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:32.349
AWS does that for you.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.620
Many of the world's fastest growing businesses,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.960
such as Lyft, Airbnb, Netflix, and Snap,

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.684
as well as enterprises such as Samsung,

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:45.439
Toyota, and Capital One,

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.689
depend on this scale and performance of

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.530
DynamoDB to support their mission critical workloads.
