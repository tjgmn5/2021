00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.285
In this lesson, I introduced you to storing files or objects in the Cloud using S3.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:10.890
Remember that S3 Glacier is good for data archiving purposes,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.565
and is intended for data you plan to access less frequently.

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:18.285
You learnt about a NoSQL database called DynamoDB.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.780
We talked about red shift which holds large volumes

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.455
of data that need to be analyzed or reported against.

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:30.195
We also discussed using CloudFront as a way to speed up content delivery.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.850
Next I will teach you about Security.
