00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.800
Hello. My name is Alfredo Deza and I'm a software engineer with

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.565
about 10 years of experience with Python

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:20.505
and with a background on system administration and DevOps.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:25.245
I am excited to have the opportunity to have

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:32.280
created the Jenkins Pipeline on AWS project for this course.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.000
I hope at the end of it you get to learn how to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.609
deploy and run an instance on AWS and configure Jenkins,

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.310
and run some pipelines that might be able to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.600
deploy a static website on S3, at the end of it
