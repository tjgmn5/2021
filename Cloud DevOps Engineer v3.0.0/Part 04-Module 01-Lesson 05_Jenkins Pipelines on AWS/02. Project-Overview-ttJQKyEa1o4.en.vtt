00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.395
Hello. My name is Alfredo Deza.

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:11.550
I'm going to give you a brief walk-through through

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.700
the project to create a Jenkins Pipeline set up on AWS.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.060
Right here, we're seeing the AWS console for a specific user that has been

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.500
created with the right permissions to run a T2 micro instance.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.135
It's a VM that is running on the US East zone,

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:42.020
and the VM has been running for a little while now.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.190
We have gone ahead and set up this machine so that we can install and configure

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.745
Jenkins and connect to your instance

00:00:56.745 --> 00:01:01.640
pop up gives you a little bit of an overview of how to get there,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.850
how to connect and get to your machine.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.085
This instance is now running.

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:17.415
We're going to see that now Jenkins is running on this URL,

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:21.195
and you can see the port 8080 is being used.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:28.540
This is the basic bare-bones Jenkins interface that we went ahead and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.615
installed and configured Blue Ocean which is the pipeline ready version of Jenkins,

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:41.105
which should give us a nice interface

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:45.550
or a nicer interface in these so that we can visualize better our pipelines.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.240
A link should appear here staying open Blue Ocean,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.250
and let's click that and see how that looks.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.900
Once this loads, you can see that there is, first of all,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.370
everything looks very different,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.480
and we have one item in our pipeline called static.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.680
Let's click on that and see how that looks again.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.815
You can see here there's been three runs.

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:17.275
The first one when the project was created,

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:20.085
then a passing one.

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:27.840
Apparently things got fixed there and a third one where invalid HTML was done.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.480
The usefulness of pipelines here is that it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.605
will prevent certain items in the pipeline to continue if there is a failure.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:44.525
Let's look at how the first one got messed up.

00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:53.005
But you can see here that the linking step failed and nothing was uploaded to AWS.

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:59.895
Basically, here was an error where the Linter was not installed.

00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:01.890
Here you get tidy not found.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.965
We're using tidy, which is an HTML Linter.

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:08.390
After it got installed into the system,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.285
we went ahead and rerun,

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:17.595
and you can see here how the Linting step went okay,

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:21.515
and then the file was finally uploaded to AWS.

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:27.600
This stage went and pushed the changes to Static Jenkins Pipeline,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.040
which is the bucket I created,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.320
and the upload was successful.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.520
The pipeline as well has been set up to be pulling changes from

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.290
GitHub from the static repo or static project.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.695
Whenever there's a change,

00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:46.775
like you can see here,

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:50.900
a change was pushed so that invalid HTML was created.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.840
It prevented an upload to AWS for the next step.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.250
When there's a problem with the Linting step,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.235
the Linter complains and

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:07.885
in this case it's the complaints about it that shouldn't be there.

00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:16.000
This is all really useful and whenever there's a successful step like this one,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.570
the pipeline will push the changes to the static URL.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.855
Though the index file looks like this,

00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:31.010
and it's just very basic HTML that has

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.890
a single line that says this is the first paragraph in a simple static HTML site,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.860
and there's no CSS or JavaScript.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.224
It was up on Amazon S3,

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:48.570
which is this one.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.420
Static Jenkins pipeline, which again,

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.965
this is the name of the bucket.

00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:57.035
It should be unique for every single packet that is created here,

00:04:57.035 --> 00:05:01.820
and it has enabled static hosting.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.960
It has DS3 website and it's on Amazon AWS.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.235
The contents of these is the exact same as in the repo.

00:05:12.235 --> 00:05:17.869
Though whenever a change is done to the repository that changes the index HTML

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:23.345
and the pipeline is successful with a Linting and uploading files to Amazon,

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:25.615
it will work fine.

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:34.750
Again, this is just how things will work once everything is tied up together.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.820
There's a lot of things that you can do here like rerun and basically

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.005
wait for things to get triggered once there are changes in GitHub.

00:05:48.005 --> 00:05:54.315
That's it. That's the overview for the Jenkins pipelines on AWS Project,

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:58.520
and I hope you get to learn how to deploy and configure

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.620
these and deploy some pipelines. Thank you.
