The Docker App itself orchestrates the local development workflow including the ability to use [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), which is an open-source system for managing containerized applications that came out of Google.\n\n#### Docker Hub Overview\n\nSo what is Docker Hub and what problem does it solve?  Just as the [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) source code ecosystem has local developer tools like [vim](https://www.vim.org/), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) that work with it, Docker Desktop works with Docker containers and allows for local use and development.\n\nWhen collaborating with `git` outside of the local environment, developers often use platforms like [Github](https://github.com/) or [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) to communicate with other parties and share code.  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) works in a similar way.  Docker Hub allows developers to share docker containers that can serve as a base image for building new solutions.  \n\nThese base images can be built by experts and certified to be high quality:  i.e. the [official Python developers have a base image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python).  This allows a developer to leverage the expertise of the true expert on a particular software component and improve the overall quality of their container.  This is a similar concept to using a library developed by another developer versus writing it yourself.\n",

              "text": "### Real-World Examples of Containers\n\nWhat problem do [Docker format containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/) solve?  In a nutshell, the operating system runtime can be packaged along with the code, and this solves a particularly complicated problem with a long history.  There is a famous meme that goes \"It works on my machine!\".  While this is often told as a joke to illustrate the complexity of deploying software, it is also true.  Containers solve this exact problem.  If the code works in a container, then the container configuration can be checked in as code.  Another way to describe this concept is that the actual Infrastructure is treated as code.  This is called IaC (Infrastructure as Code).\n\nHere are a few specific examples:\n\n#### Developer Shares Local Project\nA developer can work on a web application that uses `flask` (a popular Python web framework).  The installation and configuration of the underlying operating system is handled by the Docker container file.  Another team member can checkout the code and use `docker run` to run the project.  This eliminates what could be a multi-day problem of configuring a laptop correctly to run a software project.\n\n#### Data Scientist shares Jupyter Notebook with a Researcher at another University\nA data scientist working with [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) style notebooks wants to share a complex data science project that has multiple dependencies on C, Fortran, R, and Python code.  They package up the runtime as a Docker container and eliminate the back and forth over several weeks that occurs when sharing a project like this.  \n\n#### A Machine Learning Engineer Load Tests a Production Machine Learning Model\nA Machine learning engineer has been tasked with taking a new model and deploying it to production.  Previously, they were concerned about how to accurately test the accuracy of the new model before committing to it.  The model recommends products to paying customers and, if it is inaccurate, it costs the company a lot of money.  Using containers, it is possible to deploy the model to a fraction of the customers, only 10%, and if there are problems, it can be quickly reverted.  If the model performs well, it can quickly replace the existing models.\n",

Here is a breakdown:\n\n* Size:  Containers are much smaller than Virtual Machines (VM) and run as isolated processes versus virtualized hardware.  VMs can be GBs while containers can be MBs.\n* Speed:  Virtual Machines can be slow to boot and take minutes to launch.  A container can spawn much more quickly typically in seconds.\n* Composability:  Containers are designed to be programmatically built and are defined as source code in an Infrastructure as Code project (IaC).  Virtual Machines are often replicas of a manually built system.  Containers make IaC workflows possible because they are defined as a file and checked into source control alongside the project’s source code.\n",

A main benefit to a `Makefile` is the ability to enforce a convention. If everytime you work a project you follow a few simple steps, it reduces the possibility of errors in building and testing a project.\n\nA typical Python project can be improved by adding a `Makefile` with the following steps:  `make setup`, `make install`, `make test`, `make lint` and `make all`.  \n\n```Makefile\nsetup:\n\tpython3 -m venv ~/.myrepo\n\ninstall:\n\tpip install --upgrade pip &&\\\n\t\tpip install -r requirements.txt\n\ntest:\n\tpython -m pytest -vv --cov=myrepolib tests/*.py\n\tpython -m pytest --nbval notebook.ipynb\n\n\nlint:\n\tpylint --disable=R,C myrepolib cli web\n\nall: install lint test\n```\n\nThis example is from a tutorial repository called [`myrepo`](https://github.com/noahgift/myrepo).  There is also an article about how to use it from [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/increase-reliability-in-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-circleci/).\n\nThe general idea is that a convention eliminates the need to think about what to do.  For every project, there is a common way to install software, a common way to test software and a common way to test and lint software.  Just like `vim`, a `Makefile` build system is often already on a Unix or Linux system.  Even Microsoft uses the [Linux operating system in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/linux-on-azure/), and the result is that Linux is the preferred deployment target for most software.\n",

In our case, it also install the `pytest` and `pylint` libraries used later on in the Makefile.\n- `test`: This is broken into two parts for testing.\n  - First, it will use `.py` files in the `tests` directory. The `-vv` flag ensures short test durations are still shown (see [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html#profiling-test-execution-duration)), while the `-cov` flag helps to calculate what the test coverage of the code is (see [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)) in a given directory.\n  - The second line is used to test Jupyter Notebook cells. The `--nbval` flag makes pytest pay attention to jupyter notebooks (see [documentation](https://nbval.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).\n- `lint`: This will lint what is in the `myrepolib` directory, as well as the `cli.py` and `web.py` files in our current directory (see video). The `--disable=R,C` is used to disable the \"convention\" (C) and \"refactor\" (R) message classes (see related [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31907762/pylint-to-show-only-warnings-and-errors)).\n- `all`: You may notice this line looks a little different than the above lines, with the commands on the same line.

Makefiles have plenty of different commands and variables that can be used - check out [this page](https://makefiletutorial.com/) for a long list of them.\n\nWhile you will start from scratch in this exercise, if you need to look at another example of a Makefile, you can check out [this Makefile](https://github.com/udacity/DevOps_Microservices/tree/master/Lesson-3-Containerization/Makefile) in the course repository. This additional example Makefile will be used in the next lesson on containerization.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Create an empty `Makefile` using the `touch` command\n- Create two commands:  `cmd1` and `cmd2` and make this `echo` the name of the command. \n  - Note that Makefiles will normally print out each line as it goes, but here we want it to just explicitly `echo` the command names. Check out the link above to figure out how you can stop a line from printing. \n  - Makefiles have an automatic variable that contains the target name for the commands you create. You can also find this in the link above to add to your Makefile.\n- Create an `all` command that runs both `cmd1` and `cmd2` \n- Run `make all` to see the output\n",

An example of this is as follows:\n\n#### Example Makefile for Docker and CircleCI\n```bash \nsetup:\n\tpython3 -m venv ~/.container-revolution-devops\n\ninstall:\n\tpip install --upgrade pip &&\\\n\t\tpip install -r requirements.txt\n\ntest:\n\t#python -m pytest -vv --cov=myrepolib tests/*.py\n\t#python -m pytest --nbval notebook.ipynb\n\nvalidate-circleci:\n\t# See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#processing-a-config\n\tcircleci config process .circleci/config.yml\n\nrun-circleci-local:\n\t# See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#running-a-job\n\tcircleci local execute\n\nlint:\n\thadolint demos/flask-sklearn/Dockerfile\n\tpylint --disable=R,C,W1203,W1202 demos/**/**.py\n\nall: install lint test\n```\n\nA `Dockerfile` linter is called [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) checks for bugs in a `Dockerfile`.  A [local version of the CircleCI build system](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/) allows for testing in the same environment as the SaaS offering.  The minimalist approach is still present.  A user only needs to remember to use the same commands:  `make install`, `make lint` and `make test`, but the `lint` step is more complete and powerful with the inclusion of `Dockerfile` as well as `Python` linting.\n\n*Notes about installing `hadolint` and `circleci`:* \nIf you are on OS X you can `brew install hadolint`. If you are on another platform follow the instructions from [the `hadolint` GitHub repo](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/).  To install the local version of `circleci` on OS X or Linux you can run `curl -fLSs https://circle.ci/cli | bash` or follow the official instructions for [local version of the CircleCI build system](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/).\n\n",

One way to dramatically simplify installation and configuration in the Cloud is to use a Cloud based development environment like AWS Cloud9.  This was shown in the AWS Lambda examples in Lesson 1.  This allows you to eliminate a huge portion of the problems you can run into when installing software.  If you are expert at installing software on Linux, Windows or OS X, then this may not matter.  If you want the easiest path to running these commands, use AWS Cloud9.\n\n### Reference\n- [Increase reliability in data science and machine learning projects with CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/increase-reliability-in-data-science-and-machine-learning-projects-with-circleci/)\n- [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)",

They are often megabytes in size.\n\n#### Virtual Machine\n\nA virtual machine is the emulation of a physical operating system.  They can be Gigabytes in size.\n\n#### Docker Format Container\n\nThere are several formats for containers.  An emerging form is Docker, which involves the definition of a `Dockerfile.`\n\n#### pip\n\nThe `pip` tool installs Python packages.\n\n#### pylint\n\nThe `pylint` tool checks the Python source code for syntax errors.\n\n#### black\n\nThe `black` tool formats the text of Python source code automatically.\n\n#### pytest\n\nThe `pytest` tool is a framework for running tests on Python source code.\n\n#### IPython\n\nThe `ipython` interpreter is an interactive terminal for Python.  It is the core of the Jupyter notebook.\n\n#### Makefile\n\nA `Makefile` is a file that contains a set of directives used to build software.
