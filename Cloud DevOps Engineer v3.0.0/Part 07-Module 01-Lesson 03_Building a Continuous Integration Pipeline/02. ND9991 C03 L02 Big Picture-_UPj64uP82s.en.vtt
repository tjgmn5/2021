00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.990
Let's start with a question,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.135
What is CI anyway?

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:09.510
Well, CI stands for continuous integration.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.090
As you can imagine, it has something to do with integrating

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.985
something and doing it continuously.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.930
I think Atlassian has one of the best definitions out there.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.125
Continuous integration is the practice of automating

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.020
the integration of code changes from

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.905
multiple contributors into a single software project.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:33.800
You can think of CI as something that repeatedly facilitates

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.145
the combining of work of multiple developers into one product.

00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:44.435
Once your team has continuous integration set up and running on every commit,

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.435
you'll notice some new doors opening up.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:49.050
You'll have a singular,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.875
unified, consistent build process.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:58.735
You'll have automatically packaged downloadable "binaries".

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:02.945
You'll notice faster recovery from botched integrations.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.090
My team has a saying, if you broke it,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.010
you fix it, and your unit test suite is going to get some renewed respect.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.425
You'll have greater transparency and communication amongst your teammates,

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:22.370
and you'll get to spend more time developing software and adding value.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.599
Even though continuous integration,

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.060
CI and continuous deployment,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.995
CD are often mentioned together,

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:33.625
they are different processes with very different goals.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:38.395
The difference is mostly important when deciding triggers and timing.

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:42.850
There are times when you should run CI related jobs in pipelines,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.565
but not anything related to CD.

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:50.605
There are even times when you might run CD and leave CI to rest,

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:53.680
and of course, there are perfectly valid scenarios when you

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.200
would want to run them both one after the other.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.995
Continuous integration is all about the source code.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:04.940
New changes to the code need to be validated, verified,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.370
exercised, worked over, massaged,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.175
and squeezed to see if there are any leaks.

00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:13.850
We do this by compiling and transpiling, linting,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.660
running unit tests, performing static analysis, things like that.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.270
If the task has to do with source code,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.705
it's part of CI.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:27.125
On the other hand, continuous deployment is all about,

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.155
you guessed it, deployment.

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:31.715
Once a source code has been built in CI,

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:36.800
we're ready to ship it to servers and devices either in the same network or elsewhere.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.000
Depending on your team's delivery process and deployment strategy,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.680
you might deploy to a staging or pre-production server for final testing,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.860
or you might deploy to production right away.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.300
Before doing so, CD can run scripts to prepare the infrastructure,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.955
run smoke tests, and handle roll back in reverse if something doesn't go as planned.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:03.020
Understanding the difference between CI and CD will help

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.680
you be a better steward of the resources used by each.
