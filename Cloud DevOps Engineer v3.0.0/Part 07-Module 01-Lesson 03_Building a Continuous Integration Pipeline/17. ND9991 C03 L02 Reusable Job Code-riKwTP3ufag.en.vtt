00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.670
Just like your production code should be clean and maintainable,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.060
so should your CI/CD configuration code.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.675
One way to keep your code clean is to reduce duplication.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.770
CircleCI gives us a couple of ways to reuse code.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.315
This is really useful in scenarios like

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:22.830
having a set of common defaults to reuse in various jobs,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.369
rollbacks that may happen when a job fails,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.820
compiling code and other repeated boilerplate code,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.695
deployments especially when you've got the same deployment plan for all environments.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:39.640
Let's take a look at a couple of ways to dry up your config code.
