00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.090
The first time I heard about continuous integration was when

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.585
I was on a project working for the IRS in the United States,

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.690
I was part of a team of about six developers and we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.910
were all working more or less on the same code base.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.205
Tensions were almost always constantly high,

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.245
and someone was always checking in new code,

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.255
new bugs, or compile errors.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:27.290
Half the time the developer who introduced the bug didn't even know about it

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.045
until hours or days later when it was discovered by another developer.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:35.000
With an aggressive delivery schedule bearing down

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.610
on us and all of these integration problems,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.840
I truly dreaded going to work every day.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.050
Then, one of the senior developers installed Team City,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.630
which was a continuous integration tool.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.975
He can figured Team City to watch our repository and run some scripts on every commit.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.700
Then he said whoever breaks the build fixes the build.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.405
The effect was almost instant.

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:05.325
Integration issues went from daily to weekly and eventually monthly.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:08.195
Our code quality started increasing.

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.760
We even started taking better care of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.780
our unit tests since they could break the build too.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.080
Since then, I always insist on some CI tool when working on a team.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.940
In this lesson, I hope to give you enough information and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.180
practice in the art of continuous integration that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.345
you too will be able to adopt and implement it in any of your future projects.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:36.290
Together, we will learn about CI and how it fits

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.535
into the bigger picture so that you can make great decisions on how to use it.

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.400
We'll discuss some behaviors of

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.180
CI veterans so that you can emulate those behaviors and dazzle your coworkers.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.700
We'll talk about some of the different CI tools out

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.080
there so that you'll be more tool agnostic.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.985
We'll go over some of the common building blocks

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.090
of most CI tools like environment variables,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.720
triggers, pipelines, jobs, file-sharing between jobs,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.330
reusable job code, and job failures, things like that.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.810
Also that you'll be equipped with what it takes to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.590
build complete CI pipelines. Let's get started.
