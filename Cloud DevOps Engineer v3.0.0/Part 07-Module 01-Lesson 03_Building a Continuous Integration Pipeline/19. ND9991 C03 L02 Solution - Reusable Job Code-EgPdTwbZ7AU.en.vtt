00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.230
Congratulations. You now have a powerful tool at your disposal to keep your jobs dry.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.905
Don't repeat yourself.

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:12.105
Repeating code causes extra maintenance burden.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.950
When possible, you should try to avoid repeating code.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.445
When it makes sense, try to put this newfound skill to work by utilizing commands,

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:25.775
anchors, and aliases to keep your pipeline code maintainable.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.150
Let's take a quick look at my code

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.185
and let you compare your code to mine and see how you did.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:35.830
You may have actually done your solution a couple of different ways.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.180
So I'm going to show you both.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.010
In this first case,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.325
I've got a job that is referencing a command right here by stamp print pipeline ID.

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:48.820
You can see here very simply print pipeline ID.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.790
It has steps and it's going to simply

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.780
echo or print this circle workflow ID to my console.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.895
So let's say I would rather pass that workflow ID into my command as a parameter.

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:11.820
So let's make a quick change to my command so that we can accomplish this goal.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.300
We don't need a default.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.420
So there's my perimeter being used.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.550
Now I need to pass the circle workflow ID into my step in my job.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.100
For that all I need to do is add a colon here and my ID parameter here,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.570
and for that I need to use pipeline variables.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.090
Again, I'm going to use this double bracket and I'm going to say pipeline ID.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.840
Now my job uses a parameterized command,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.065
which puts the pipeline ID using

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:07.615
pipeline variables instead of

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:12.410
environment variables into the command so that it can be used there.
