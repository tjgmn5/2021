Great job. As you may already know,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.480
environment variables are a very important piece of the CI/CD puzzle.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.270
Sending your name down from a project level

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.345
to a job through an environment variable is pretty cool,

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.520
but there are plenty of other applications.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.125
Take secrets, for example.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:24.690
Environment variables are a great way to store those secrets that are needed by any job.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.085
Let's take a look together at my code below and see how you did.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.820
Here's my very simple job code that takes

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.130
my environment variable from

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.365
the project environment variables and just prints it out on the screen.

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:41.810
I just want to point out that you are able to choose pretty much

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.225
any image as long as it supports the code that's going to be running in the steps.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:51.740
So in this case it could have been a super lightweight alpine based image,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.990
or it could have been a node image.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.110
Here, I just chose c image base 2020.01,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.290
but it could really be almost any image at all and right here,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.945
this is my code that I'm actually going to run.

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.120
I've named it to be a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.060
descriptive that we're going to echo an environment variable as part of our project.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.815
Then just have the shell command that I want to run,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:18.510
where it just echoes out this environment variable referenced with a dollar sign.
