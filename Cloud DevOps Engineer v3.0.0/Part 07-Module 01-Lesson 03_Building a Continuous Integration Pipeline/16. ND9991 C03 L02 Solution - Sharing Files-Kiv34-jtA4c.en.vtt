00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.320
Sharing files between jobs is something we might

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.960
take for granted as normal computer users.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.510
You save a file and a program and you expect to be

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.300
able to open that same file in another program.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.025
But we have to think about these pipeline jobs as completely separate computers.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:21.800
We can think of cache or our workspace as a USB memory stick.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.070
Take a look at my code and see how close your solution was to mine.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.920
So here you can see that my job looks very similar

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.325
to the previous jobs that we've had in these exercises.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:37.065
We have here the usual suspects like a Docker image and some steps.

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:41.045
The main difference here is that we are

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:44.510
here persisting something to the workspace, our output file,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.435
which was generated here,

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:49.220
and we have attached to workspace,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.750
which is getting that file back out,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.255
which then we can just cat and display that output text.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:01:00.275
The main thing here that we need to make sure that we do is that we use the same route

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:05.545
in this place and the at directive here.

00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:11.435
Once we do that, we should be able to assume that the file is there for us,

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:14.610
just as if it had always been there.
