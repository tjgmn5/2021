00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.840
It's useful to have access to a global values from time to time for using your jobs.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.710
Sometimes these global values are set by you or your organization,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.860
other times they're built into the CI/CD tool.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.635
CircleCI has a handful of values called pipeline values that might come in handy.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.835
You can use them almost anywhere in your jobs with a simple syntax.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:25.395
Let's take a quick look.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:27.315
What I'm showing you here is

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:32.555
CircleCI's wonderful documentation and the section on pipeline values.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:34.670
Now you could get to this documentation very easily.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.920
I left you a link down below the video,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.175
but let's take a look at a few of the values.

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:42.210
Here, we've got a pipeline.id.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.795
This is extremely useful when we want to name things uniquely,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:49.745
but based on the pipeline.

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.080
So that we can share them sometimes between jobs.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.985
Each job may not be able to communicate with one another,

00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:00.710
but we can at least have some common ground with the pipeline.id.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.305
We also have a pipeline.number,

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:06.290
which is just an auto incremented number that

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.830
is getting bigger and bigger for every build that we run.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.950
We also are able to key off of different things like the git URL,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.294
the project type, the git tag, and the branch.

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:23.210
We're able to include these values in our code,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.990
in our shell scripts, for instance.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.920
Here's an example job where we have an environment variable.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.735
We're trying to build up an environment variable called CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:41.450
We reference a pipeline value by wrapping it in these double brackets,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.940
and then we just say pipeline.project.git_url.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.090
This is building up a URL so that we can actually do maybe

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.925
a diff on some files on a git revision.

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:59.600
It's pulling in the different git revision, the SHA tags.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.840
Here's the base revision and here's the revision.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.680
Also, we can echo things out to the console,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.075
this is a pipeline ID.

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:11.675
Then we can use the pipeline value,

00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:13.610
which is just pipeline.id.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.620
So incredibly useful stuff.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.449
Now, pipeline values cannot be used outside of the job context.

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:25.590
For example, you cannot use these in a shell script.
