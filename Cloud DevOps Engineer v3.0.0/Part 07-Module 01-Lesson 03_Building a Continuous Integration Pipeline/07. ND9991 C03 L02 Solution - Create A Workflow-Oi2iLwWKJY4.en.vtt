00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.085
Congratulations on creating your first CI job.

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:10.365
As you can see, the job was only a conduit through which you can carry out commands.

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:14.205
Can you already see how you can begin to automate tasks?

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:18.555
Let's take a look at my code and see how yours differs from mine.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:23.190
Hey, you caught me still modifying my configuration file.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.390
You've probably already done this.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.635
But since I started with the boilerplate code from CircleCI,

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:32.640
it had this orbs section in it and it was doing

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.720
the work of the hello world and the exercise was to add our own hello world.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.450
So I'm actually going to remove this orbs section and also this CircleCI added for us.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.475
Now we have basically what you should already have.

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:49.760
We've got a jobs section where we have print hello.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.030
We've got a docker image for each of our steps,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.030
we're using CircleCI node 13 for both of our jobs.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.120
We have one step and each job where it's just echoing something,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.460
either hello or world.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.680
Down here in our workflow section,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.985
we have a very simple workflow it's called welcome.

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:12.045
It has two jobs.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:13.160
We've got print hello,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.795
which is going to run first,

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.080
and then we're going to run print world after

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.150
print hello finishes because here we have our requires.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.790
I'll let the copy of the code below the video if you'd like to check it out some more.
