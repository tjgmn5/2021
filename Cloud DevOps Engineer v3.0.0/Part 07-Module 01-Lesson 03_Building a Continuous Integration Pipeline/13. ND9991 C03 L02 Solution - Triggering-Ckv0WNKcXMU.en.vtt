00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.800
You've just taken the first step into CI.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.490
Nothing would have been possible without that first Git commit.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.735
Thanks to that seemingly insignificant act of committing new code,

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:16.410
your CI server is now aware of new changes.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.830
New changes means new possibilities to break.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.100
Now, we are ready to build, test, analyze,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.470
and anything else we want to do to the code,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.650
to see if those changes are friend or foe.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
By triggering CI so close to the introduction of these changes,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.270
we are shortening the feedback loop and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.315
reducing the time between introduction and repair,

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.630
which translates to reduced costs for businesses bottom-line.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.105
You see what I did there?

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.585
Git triggers reduce costs.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:50.760
Now, let's walk through how to complete this exercise. All right.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.900
So I have forked the example repository and now I have it in my own account.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.135
So now, I'm able to go over to CircleCI and actually set it up.

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:05.130
I can see that it's, found it already,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.355
it's right here in the third position so I'm going to set this project up.

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:12.425
It recognizes this as a node project,

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.120
but I'm not too concerned about that

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.185
because I'm going to be able to take this much farther than they're built-in.

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.850
Besides, this project already has a configuration.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.900
So I'm just going to start building there and add manually,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.575
because I don't want CircleCI to add the configuration for me.

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.935
Now I'll start building.

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:33.575
So we should be able to see that

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:38.030
the project is now here and I've been running this in the past of course,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.645
so you can see that these have failed in the past.

00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:42.210
But, we've just added it,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.860
we haven't actually run a build yet.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.900
I want to show how we can trigger this from a commit in Git.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.560
So let's go over here and actually make a change to our file here and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.360
I'm just going to add a hello world to the top of the ReadMe.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.525
This is going to say,

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:07.935
adding hello world, and we'll commit that. All right.

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:10.430
That has been committed, so we should be able to go over here and, yeah,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.990
we can see that CircleCI is running the build for us automatically.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.800
The contents of the build we're not too concerned with at this moment,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.500
but just the fact that Git was able to trigger a build in CircleCI is more than enough.
