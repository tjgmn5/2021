You may have noticed in my explanations of cash and workspace that

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.635
Circle CI only gives us the ability to save and share files and folders.

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:14.440
But what about just bits of information?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.560
If you use Circle CI's built-in options you'll

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.665
have to write a bit of information to a file,

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:22.825
cache or persist the file,

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.255
retrieve the file on the other job,

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:28.975
and then parse the information back into a variable.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.080
There are a couple of options that might be interesting

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.300
if you find that built-in process cumbersome.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.410
That is to use a secret keeper which is

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.665
a third-party service that will receive and provide your secret on command.

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:49.700
Two great options are HashiCorp's Vault which is a web service and a command line tool

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.640
that work together to give you the ability to save

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.095
bits of information securely and then retrieve them later.

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.884
Since the service is not dependent on the job or pipeline

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:04.255
your jobs can reliably save and retrieve information at will.

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:09.080
There's also Memstash which is an ultra-lightweight web service that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.080
takes your key value pairs and stores them securely for a short period of time.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.000
Is a great low ceremony way to store

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.915
quick values and get them back out no matter which job you're running.

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:27.970
For Memstash just use curl to save and retrieve your information no sign-up necessary.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.065
So let's take a quick look at Memstash.

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:34.595
Memstash has three basic inputs a token,

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.590
a key, and a value.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.320
So this token we can generate a new one as we wish.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.495
We can enter a key and I'll say Mickey,

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:48.030
and we'll say Mouse as the value.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.710
So I'll just use the web tool here to try it out,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.505
and I can see down here there's a curl statement that has

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:59.540
put the key as here in the URL and then it's got the value as the data.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.040
So I'm going to test the put.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.625
So I'm just going to put that says the value has been saved.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.910
So I've still got my key up here I'm just going to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.160
test the get and see if I get that value back.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.570
Yeah there it is. So it got the value back.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.719
Now the nice thing about this tool is I can put my key up here and my value,

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.285
and it actually generates a nice little curl statement for me. Very convenient.

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:26.020
Then if I want to get the same value out with the key then I could actually

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.770
use this get curl right here which will get the value back out.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.620
So we can actually do that in the terminal.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.150
So let's try that copy,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.150
paste, and this is going to put the value.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.295
I'm going to change it though to something else Mickey Mouse2.

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:49.920
So we'll Save that item has been created.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.255
Great. So let's go back over here to Memstash and Copy our curl out.

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:56.985
So our key hasn't changed that changes the value.

00:02:56.985 --> 00:02:59.145
So now I should be able to copy that,

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.755
go back over here, paste it again,

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.870
and we should get our Mouse2 value back.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.290
Let's try it. There it is Mouse2.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.920
So if you know how to use Shell very well you know that any value like this you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.870
can just pipe right into an environment

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.660
variable or into a text file or whatever you want to do,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.920
and this is just light years ahead of trying to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.750
save information to a little file and then retrieve the file later and parsing the file.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.190
This is just a very easy,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.350
simple lightweight way to do it.
