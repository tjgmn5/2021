00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.230
What you just did in a few minutes,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.325
used to take us days and a lot more code. A great job.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.845
You now have a complete CI pipeline,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.350
one that checks the code at several levels and

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.200
finds any problems before they become bigger.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.740
Take a look at my code,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.765
can you see how you could implement this in your own code?

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.520
What would you have done differently?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.875
Here's my solution code again.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.465
Like yours probably does,

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.160
mine has three jobs;

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.620
build, test, and analyze.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.315
Of course, each job has very common elements.

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:39.700
They're really only wrapping commands that you could do from your own terminal.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.040
As you can see, we've been able to put together all the different building blocks

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.425
and create a complete CI pipeline with very little code.

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.890
Isn't that exciting? Way to go.
