00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.100
Job failures are not only inevitable,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.565
they're good, it's the whole point of CI.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:14.325
Find that bad code as fast as possible and stop it from ruining all the good code.

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:19.155
Sometimes it's enough for the bill to just fail and for the pipeline to stop.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:22.290
Other times, you want to do something as a result,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.855
maybe send a message or delete a file,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.985
maybe update an API, who knows.

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.650
For whatever comes your way,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
now you have the ability to handle errors any way you see fit.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.475
Take a look here at the code that I have to test out this when on_fail condition.

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:43.500
You can see here that I have a step that is returning a one,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.770
that is simulating an error message, anything non-zero.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.910
So then that means that this step is going to trigger and it's going

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.265
to print out Hello Error to my console.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:01.860
It's happening all because of when on_fail.
