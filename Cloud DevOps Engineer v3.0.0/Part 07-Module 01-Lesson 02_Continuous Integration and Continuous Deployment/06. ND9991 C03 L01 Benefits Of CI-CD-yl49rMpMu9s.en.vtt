00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.900
As a technical person myself,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.620
it's easy for me to pick up on ways that this could transform a team.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.420
You might be right there with me,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.540
but business-minded decision-makers often appreciate

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.945
things in different ways than a technical minded person.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.500
If we want to convince them to fund a CI/CD project

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.100
or adjust processes to work better with continuous delivery,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.380
we need to get on the same page.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.320
So instead of spending time selling you on the concept of CI/CD,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.050
let's talk about how to sell it to others.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.510
Often we technologists have no problems

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.590
speaking and understanding the language of technology.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.540
But the technical benefits of CI/CD may not

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.460
always be so compelling to folks on the business side of the company.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.370
It's a good idea when trying to sell or defend the idea of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.095
CI/CD to decision-makers to try to do some translation on our side.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:58.520
In order to translate technical benefits to business benefits,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.510
we need to think in terms of value.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.190
One helpful framework that I like to use is

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.745
this Value Framework created by Black Swan Farming.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:09.665
It's extremely simple.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:15.215
This framework says that business value will do one of four things.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:18.485
It'll increase revenue, protect revenue,

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.235
reduce cost, or avoid cost.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:26.060
Let's apply this framework to our CI/CD benefits and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.675
see what kind of business translations we can come up with.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:33.995
CI/CD is able to catch compile errors after merge.

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.080
That's a great technical benefit.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.844
The business value could be reducing costs,

00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:45.970
because less developer time on issues from new developer code.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.000
CI/CD is able to catch unit test failures.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.179
The business value could be avoiding cost,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.470
because less bugs in production save on repair bills.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.615
CI/CD is able to detect security vulnerabilities.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:04.265
The business value of course,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:10.325
is avoiding cost because we can prevent embarrassing or costly security holes.

00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:12.840
Saying the phrase, "Save money or save

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.420
face," are two sure fire ways to get the business team on board.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.365
CI/CD is able to automate infrastructure creation.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:24.919
The business value could be avoiding cost

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:30.890
because less human errors means faster and more consistent deployments.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.175
CI/CD is able to automate infrastructure clean up.

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:38.495
The business value, could be reducing costs,

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:44.580
because we would have less infrastructure costs from unused resources.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.370
CI/CD gives us faster and more frequent production deployments.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.505
The business value could be increasing revenue,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:58.475
because we have new value generating features being released more quickly.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:04.250
The only thing most companies love more than saving money is making more of it.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.125
CI/CD allows us to deploy to production without manual checks.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.080
The business value could be increased revenue,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.500
because features will take less time to go to market.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.950
While it may be exciting for you and me to be able to say

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.460
we can spend less time doing time-consuming manual checks,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.930
using the magic phrase,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.385
"Less time to market," is a much quicker way to get their attention."

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:31.925
CI/CD can perform automated smoke tests.

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.060
The business value could be protecting revenue,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.365
because we would have reduced downtime from deployment related crash or major bug.

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:47.615
CI/CD is able to automate rollbacks triggered by job failures.

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:50.330
The business value could be protecting revenue,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.705
because we could have a quick undo process

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:57.760
to return production to a working state in case things go wrong.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.395
If only I had an automated rollback the time I gave my wife a mixer for her birthday.

00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:08.280
Things are a lot easier when we speak the same language.
