00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
CI/CD isn't for every team,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.275
but I dare say it is for most teams.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.040
Let's try a quick assessment.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.000
Get out a pen and paper and mark with an X for every question you can answer with a yes.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.275
Do you invest more time developing software than coding it?

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:26.495
You know it. Do you waste time on merge issues every time you finish a feature?

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:31.535
Yes. Does your code get lost because of botched merges?

00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:33.575
Unfortunately, yes.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.890
Does your unit test suite gets skipped often?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.550
Does it have failing tests from days or weeks ago?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.565
Are you wondering what a unit test is?

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:48.035
Do slow deployments make you miss deadlines?

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:53.880
Is there a constant friction between ops and development departments?

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.890
There's only one person know how to deploy a system the right way,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.260
are you that right person?

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.470
Are deployments dreaded by the team or are they dreaded by you?

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.170
Now be honest, how many X's do you have on your paper?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.090
If you have more than one,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.855
I'd say CI/CD is right for your team.

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:18.890
If you have no X's,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.990
I'd say you couldn't find a pen or your team is made up of super humans.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.720
Now since super humans only exists in movies,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.050
it's safe to say, you've come to the right place.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.435
Now that I've painted a beautiful Utopian picture of CI/CD,

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:40.105
I'd be irresponsible if I didn't throw a little mud on it in the right places.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:43.550
Before starting down the road of CI/CD for your team,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.635
you should definitely count the costs.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:47.855
There may be a few taxes to pay.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:54.595
Let's take a look at a few things that you might need to give up if you adopt CI/CD.

00:01:54.595 --> 00:01:58.144
Since CI/CD will be in charge of deployments,

00:01:58.144 --> 00:02:02.090
you should definitely give up manual deployments altogether.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.605
Automation doesn't play nice with manual processes.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.180
Your infrastructure as code will be handling provisioning now.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.875
So, no more modification of environment settings manually.

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:18.830
You'll need to start showing some more love to your unit test suite.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.850
No more neglecting and leaving them to fail for days or weeks.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.575
Although I know it's not you doing this,

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:29.690
but let's say we're asking for a friend,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.135
no more leaving broken code in place for other developers to stumble upon.

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:39.289
CI/CD requires a high level of discipline.

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:46.505
This is going to require your entire team to level up and develop some new disciplines.

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:50.480
Adding CI/CD to your team means that you're going to need to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.265
acquire some additional skills to maintain and extend the system.

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:58.445
Now that being said, I really do think it's worth it.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.105
You're still here with me,

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:02.980
so, I take it you agree.
