00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.355
We're going to take a closer look at blue-green deployment strategy.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:06.990
Not because it's the best,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.055
but because it sits right in the middle between easiest and hardest to implement.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:14.370
Also, this deployment strategy will give us a chance to look at

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.480
some universal truths about deployment strategies in general.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.905
The key mechanism in blue-green deployment is known as the router.

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:28.175
The router's job is to direct traffic between green and blue production environments.

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:32.075
Ideally, the router could make the switch pretty fast.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.825
That speed is nice when we're going from old version to new version,

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:39.260
but it's essential when there's an issue and we need to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.240
roll back from new version two old version again.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.470
In blue-green there are several popular routers that we could choose from.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.540
One is the load balancer,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.450
it lets you switch from front-end and back-end almost instantly,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.130
it's the ideal router in most cases.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.075
Another possible router is your Content Delivery Network or CDN.

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:06.410
CDNs offer a way to switch their source files often.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.105
Again, this is almost an instant switch for front end web apps.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.200
Of course, we could use DNS to make the switch.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.585
This is a common router because it's very easy,

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:23.425
but it's a very slow process because of DNS propagation and long TTLs.

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:27.020
You could even use your own application to route traffic,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.030
although this thing adds tremendous technical debt.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.680
The jobs in your CI/CD pipeline are

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.965
greatly influenced by the deployment strategy you choose.

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.980
Blue-green deployment strategy has a few jobs

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.105
that perhaps others see CI/CD pipelines wouldn't have.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:45.740
For example, after deployment we would have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.140
an automated smoke test to validate

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.785
the deployment before switching the router and promoting to production.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:56.840
Also, we might have another smoke test like a sanity check after the switch,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.990
rollbacks would be ready at every stage to undo our changes if needed.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.530
We would also be ready to clean up old infrastructure if everything is successful.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.770
I added a list of common jobs in the text below the video,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.300
if you'd like to see the jobs and their descriptions.
