00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.050
In this section we're going to talk about CI/CD tools that you can choose from.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.280
Plenty of tools exist that can handle the entire CI and CD pipeline.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.240
Some tools can be installed on your own hardware,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.925
while others are cloud-based services.

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:25.525
Your team may prefer a CI/CD server running on-premises closer to the development team.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:30.235
There are a lot of great options with varying pricing models.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.790
One major benefit to an on-prem CI/CD server is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.150
a high degree of control over security or configuration.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.550
On the other hand, an on-prem CI/CD server

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.855
requires time from somebody in the team to maintain.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.705
Jenkins is a great example,

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:50.130
it's an open source,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.475
full-featured CI/CD server built by a vibrant community of developers.

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:57.820
Jenkins is also 100 percent free.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.440
There's also GitLab CI/CD, the community edition.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.410
GitLab CI/CD is also an open source,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.815
full-featured CI/CD server that is built by a large community of developers.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.400
GitLab also has many other useful features

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.680
like built-in git repositories and project management features.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.470
The installable community version is 100 percent free,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.075
but they also offer a paid option with hosting.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:27.350
TeamCity is a great example.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.920
It was built by JetBrains and was the first CI/CD server I ever used.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.840
TeamCity is a mature product with about every feature you could ever dream of.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.375
Plus, JetBrains offers enterprise support for TeamCity.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.120
There's also Team Foundation Server from Microsoft.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.365
This is another very mature system that includes CI/CD,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:55.825
but also other version control and project management solutions.

00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:59.930
It also has a very tight integration with Visual Studio,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.090
which might come in handy for some.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.210
Some prefer to use cloud-based services since

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.530
they require much less time to maintain and configure.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.960
One downside to cloud-based solutions like

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.635
this is that they are almost never completely free,

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:21.245
at least not when you're using it for a real team development situation.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.225
However, if you do the math,

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:27.245
you might find that the cost for a cloud-based CI/CD server is

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:32.090
less than the labor and hardware costs of an on-prem solution.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.600
Let's take a look at a few of the leaders in this space.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.805
Bamboo is a CI/CD server offered by Atlassian.

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:44.270
It integrates well with other Atlassian products,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.715
so it might be a good option if you use Jira or Bitbucket.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:55.040
Travis CI is an extremely simple CI/CD orchestration tool

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.895
that has some special features for library and package builders.

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:04.345
Travis CI is completely free for open source projects.

00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:07.205
I'll mention GitLab again here.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:09.590
In addition to their open source version,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.480
they also have a fully managed cloud-based option that can be quite convenient.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.790
CircleCI has a reputation for being one of the fastest cloud-based CI/CD servers around.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.815
We'll use this option during this course.

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:29.525
All of these have free versions,

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:31.505
but with certain limitations.

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:34.265
Again, you'll have to weigh the pros and cons with

00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:39.300
each option to find the CI/CD server that works best for you and your team.
