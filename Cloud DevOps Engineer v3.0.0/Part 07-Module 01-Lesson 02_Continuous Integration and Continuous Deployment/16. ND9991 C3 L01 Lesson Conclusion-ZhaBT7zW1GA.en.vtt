00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.590
In this lesson, we went over the concepts that make

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.620
up continuous integration and continuous deployment.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.415
We discussed the fundamentals of CI/CD,

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:14.715
some of the benefits of CI/CD,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.640
continuous delivery as a paradigm,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.735
some best practices, deployment strategies especially that blue-green deployment,

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.560
the building blocks of pipelines like stages, jobs,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.500
and steps, and we looked at several CI/CD tools on the market.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.705
This lesson was heavy on theory.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.560
It's important to have a good foundation in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.130
the concepts behind continuous delivery, continuous integration,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.760
and continuous deployment so that you don't have to repeat

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.680
the same mistakes like guys like me committed along the way.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.800
Also, knowing the basic concepts will help you to be a little more tool agnostic,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.495
meaning, you won't be pigeonholed into just one tool.

00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:10.475
In the next lesson, we'll be getting very practical and putting all this theory to use.

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:11.945
Great job so far.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:17.610
You're well on your way to building end to end CI/CD systems.
