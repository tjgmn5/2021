00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.590
It's great as a technical member of the team for you to understand the benefits of CI/CD.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.470
This way, when you're banging your head against the wall

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.665
because of some confusing mess you've gotten yourself into,

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:18.150
you'll remember the benefits and they'll motivate you to keep going.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.330
But it's quite possibly more important that you understand how

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.180
to translate these benefits to others on

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.280
the team so that they can understand

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.750
how CI/CD will benefit their area of responsibility as well.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600
Without the right language,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.880
they may not hear what you're trying to say.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.040
Remember, whenever you're attempting to convince

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.950
business people of some technical benefit,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.395
you should always translate it to either cost or revenue,

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:47.765
if the benefits truly outweigh the costs of implementation,

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.100
you'll find that the business will often give you the green light.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.990
In this way, you'll be able to operate as one team with one ubiquitous language.
