00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.650
In this lesson, we're going go over the concepts that make up

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.090
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment or CI/CD.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.000
We'll start out theoretical at first and then

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.840
start to get very practical by the next lesson.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.070
We'll start with the fundamentals of CI/CD to give you a good foundation.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.480
Then we'll talk about the benefits of CI/CD to get you excited and how

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.025
to communicate those technical benefits with non-technical colleagues.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.445
We'll talk about continuous delivery as a paradigm

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:36.495
and how it relates to continuous integration and deployment.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:40.325
We'll go over some best practices for CI/CD,

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:44.350
so that you won't have to repeat the same mistakes that I did starting out.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.600
We'll talk about some of the different deployment strategies out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.595
there and zero in on one that you can implement right away.

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:55.655
We'll take a look at the building blocks of pipelines.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:00.200
Finally, we'll look at the different CI/CD tools out on the market.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.760
It's time to get rolling,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.305
grab a caffeinated beverage of your choice and get ready.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:07.960
You're about to level up your game.
