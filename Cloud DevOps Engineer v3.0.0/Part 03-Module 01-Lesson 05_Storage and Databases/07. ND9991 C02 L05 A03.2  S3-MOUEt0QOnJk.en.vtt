00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
So let's take a moment now to talk about storage.

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.019
Everything we've seen so far as SQL or

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.269
SQL type of way of storing data which is probably needed by a lot of application.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.769
However, some application have much larger files or files that are

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.390
binaries that are not conducive to be placed inside a database.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.780
So you will find yourself in a situation where you will be

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.914
storing images or videos and you need a place to put those.

00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:35.494
In other case where you would need access to a storage outside your servers,

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.914
is when you have configuration files or some settings or

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:42.740
even sensitive encrypted data that you want to store somewhere

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.640
that you want only accessible to the servers at runtime,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.314
you will need a specific storage for these.

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:54.155
All this is happening, keep in mind because our application servers come and go.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.090
So putting something in there,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.785
you probably going to lose it based on the criteria of the auto-scaling.

00:01:00.784 --> 00:01:03.949
So you don't want anything that you want to persist to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.400
be stored in your auto scaling group servers, right?
