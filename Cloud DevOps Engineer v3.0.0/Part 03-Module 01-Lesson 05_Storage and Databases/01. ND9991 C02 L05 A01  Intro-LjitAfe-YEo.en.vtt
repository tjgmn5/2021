00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.134
In a previous lesson, we have seen how to build,

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:06.359
deploy, and automate the creation of infrastructure.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.030
However, we still have some missing pieces.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.774
Now there are full-stack architects are just complete,

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.210
we need to consider additional services that will help

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050
us with automation of tasks and things that are application might need.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.969
Because of auto scaling,

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.744
we know their obligation service will come and go.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:28.844
So how do we persist data or files such as images and video?

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:32.189
Well, we do this by using Cloud Services that will

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.434
not be running inside our servers. Let's take a look.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:39.570
In this lesson, we're going to discuss S3,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.505
or Simple Storage Service,

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:47.525
which is a place outside of our BPC where we can persist images, video files,

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:54.199
configuration files, and anything relevant to our application including log files.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.450
All their services worth mentioning are databases such as MySQL,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.480
Microsoft SQL Server, and DynamoDB,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.094
which is a very fast NoSQL database.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:08.179
Load balancing which we have deployed in our previous lesson,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.050
and one more services that you might come up is KMS,

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.939
which is Key Management Services,

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.704
which provides encryption services for your application.

00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:21.969
But for now, let's concentrate on S3.
