The goal of this lesson was to show you that there are

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.689
plenty more possibilities when it comes to automation and infrastructure as code.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.630
Storage and databases will show up for sure in

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.540
your day-to-day activities as a cloud DevOps engineer.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.140
Our intention with this project is to motivate you to look deeper

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.679
into deployment automation and DevOps services that are available to you.
