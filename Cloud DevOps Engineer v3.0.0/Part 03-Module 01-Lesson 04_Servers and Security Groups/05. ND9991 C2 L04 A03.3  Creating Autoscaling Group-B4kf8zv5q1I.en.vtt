00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.899
So we don't need anything else for our parameter file.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.365
We'll continue down.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.269
We have security groups established.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.019
Now, let's go back to our reference document.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.315
In this case, what we're going to do is we're going to be creating an auto scaling group.

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:27.220
So when you're creating an auto scaling group,

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.649
an auto scaling group what it does is,

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.920
it will create servers based on a criteria.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.380
So you could want zero servers,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.565
that's an actual valid value, zero.

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:41.189
You could have 100,

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:44.479
you can have 200 based on whatever criteria you define.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.250
For example, if you have one server

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.159
running and the CPU was being used too much like 80 percent,

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.893
90 percent of the CPU,

00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:54.534
that means that machine probably need help.

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:58.744
So that would meet their criteria to spin up another server.

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:01.894
Once the CPU usage comes back down,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.799
that secondary machine is no longer needed and it would be discarded.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.995
Now, how does the auto scaling group know what to lunch?

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:15.645
Yeah, it would need to understand what type of server are you trying to run,

00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:17.774
when to run it, and all those things.

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:19.020
So in this case,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.709
what we're going to do is we're going to provide the auto scaling

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.649
group what is known as the launch configuration.
