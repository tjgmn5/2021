00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.734
Okay, so we just exploy an application to our private cloud.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:07.125
We have a network, we have service running, and most important,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.064
we have a script that we can later update, modify,

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:13.574
and deploy as many times as needed to achieve the same goal.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:16.379
So if your application stops working,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.004
instead of wasting time or resources troubleshooting,

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:20.879
you can just redeploy everything,

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.765
and you know is going to work in a predictable manner every single time.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:26.219
In the next lesson,

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.799
let's discuss some additional services that you can deploy.
