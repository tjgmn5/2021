00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Going back to our script,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.435
if we go to our reference architecture.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.510
Now, we have everything matching exactly.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.370
We have NAT gateways,

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.680
we have web servers,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.030
we have everything, security groups.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.650
Everything is matching exactly.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.785
So now we're ready to actually deploy additional services that may be require.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.440
In this case by the way, we didn't mention,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.395
let's go back to our example here.

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.670
I want to show you something.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.745
Let's go to the launch configuration where we started this script.

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:47.825
We have security groups followed by the launch configuration,

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.860
and something that you may have missed because I didn't mention it,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.925
is that we're using a natural docker container here.

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:59.060
Docker as a platform within a platform.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.940
Imagine, we're running a virtual machine that has a container inside.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.620
So we're going to the extreme level of virtualization here and this is great you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.820
can have this so many layers of extra security and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.425
extra convenience on functionality for yourself so that you don't have to do much work.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:23.305
You can have this docker image created in the CICD pipeline,

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:25.470
and just deploy the binary

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.880
here and you don't have to worry about source code or anything like that.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.500
Your developers can actually give you a binary artifact that you can push here and

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.200
you wouldn't need much in the way of knowing how to configure it,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.220
how to properly provide parameters or nothing like that.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950
You just put it in a server and you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.900
send that out there and everything is running perfect.
