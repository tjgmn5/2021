00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Thanks to the previous lesson,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.120
we now have a solid network that we can use to deploy application.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.000
So it's time for us to create a usable example,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.830
that we can test with CloudFormation.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.005
In other words, instead of networking,

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.410
let's actually put some servers out there, and connect to them.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.499
Going back to our reference architecture,

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.385
we have now NAT gateways,

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.810
we have Internet gateways, we have subnets.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.710
What we need to do now is worry about actually deploying something.
