00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
For the purpose of security,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.515
it's great to install a web server in a private subnet without inbound Internet Axis.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:10.800
But the question is, how do we log into it to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.180
troubleshoot issues when they arise? Let's take a look.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.540
Chances are you already know what SSH is,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.915
but if not, it stands for Secure Shell,.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:25.650
It's an encrypted channel of communication between your work PC or

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.940
your laptop to another computer or server across a network.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.510
What's really important to us is that it is passwordless,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.090
meaning that all you need is your username,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000
and a private encryption key,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.210
and you're ready to connect.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.245
We're going to start with this diagram.

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:46.785
The first thing we're going to do is create the Jump Box,

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:49.865
also known as a bastion host which is simply

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.970
a server that we're going to use as a jumping point to be

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.250
able to access those servers in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.000
the private subnets that don't have a public IP address that we can reach.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.460
I realized that there are several ways around this problem,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.335
but this way that I'm about to show you,

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:08.240
it's secure, and it's simple.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.745
So let's go to our AWS Console and get started.

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:17.815
We'll start by creating a couple of SSH keys that we can use.

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:20.715
Here we are in the AWS Console,

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:23.855
so I'll select EC2,

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:28.235
and I want you to scroll down to where it says, "Key pairs."

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:34.370
Click on that, and then we're going to go ahead and create a couple of key pairs.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.870
I'll give it a name, I'll call it jumpbox-key.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.500
I'll use pem, and click "Create".

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.545
Keep in mind, you just download it.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:55.360
This file, that.pem file,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.680
and that's the private key.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.370
This is the only time that you have to download this key.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.515
If you ever lose this file,

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:07.910
you'll have to recreate a brand new key. Let's do another one.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.840
Private-server-devops-key, again, same format,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.040
pem, and click "Create."

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.280
We just downloaded that as well.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.800
Keep in mind that these files and this SSH keys are region-specific.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320
For example, in this demo,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.195
I have selected the Ohio region,

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:38.420
so I can only use it here which is where

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.160
these public keys are defined on the Amazon side.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.830
I'll go back to the EC2 dashboard and select "Running instances".

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.095
Right now we don't have anything,

00:02:52.095 --> 00:02:56.440
so let's go ahead and launch our Jump Box.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.570
I'll select "Amazon Linux" here T2.micro is fine,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.625
and now let's choose our vpc.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.255
We're going to pick a Public subnets within that vpc,

00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:18.070
because this is our Jump Box.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.255
Make sure this is enable, Auto-assign Public IP.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:27.980
You're going to need a public IP so that you can access this server.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.840
So Auto-assign Enable, make sure you get that IP from the beginning.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.655
Storage, eight gigabytes is fine.

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:42.585
For tags. I'll add a tag called Name,

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:45.280
and call it Jump Box.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.825
For the Security Group, we're going to create a brand new one,

00:03:50.825 --> 00:04:00.530
call it jump-box-security-group, and we're going to allow SSH into it.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.455
We're going to choose our own IP address,

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.610
which you can do it from here.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.900
Put a Description here, call it Administrator access,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.065
click "Review and Launch".

00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:19.115
Now when we Launch,

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:26.090
let's make sure we're selecting jumpbox-key, and acknowledge.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.170
Now we wait for our server to spin up.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.170
While we wait for our server to come online,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.255
let me show you the software.

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:46.750
So in order to SSH using the PEM or private key file that we just downloaded from AWS,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.820
you're going to need to be able to SSH,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.320
and you're going to need SEP,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.910
which stands for secure copy,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.785
which is a copy command over shell.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.085
Now if you're using Windows,

00:04:58.085 --> 00:05:01.820
you may not have these commands available to you.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.710
Let me show you how to get them.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.595
Back here in the web browser,

00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:12.380
I have another tab here and it says commander.net,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.590
cmder.net, which is a console emulator that I use.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.580
This will simulate a Linux-like console that you can use on their Windows.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.335
If you're using Linux or macOS,

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:29.150
you have no problems because you already have access to

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.240
the SSH and SEP command from your terminal.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.880
Let's go back to AWS.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.820
As you can see, our Jump Box is running.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.055
So we'll come down here where it says IPv4 Public IP,

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:46.405
and click on "Copy to clipboard".

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:50.670
Let's try to SSH to it to make sure it's working properly.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.545
So here in our terminal, we'll type SSH,

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:05.460
ec2-user which is the default user in this machine,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.285
and paste the IP that we grabbed from the console,

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:13.140
-i for identity and provide the identity.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:19.125
In this case, the jumpbox-key file that we created oi the AWS side,

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.340
I'll hit "Enter" here.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.095
It wants to add this connection,

00:06:25.095 --> 00:06:26.810
because it has never seen this before,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.655
so I'll say, "Yes."

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:35.380
Here we are, we're officially connected to our Amazon machine that we just created.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.045
Now that our Jump Box is ready,

00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:42.020
tested and restricted only to our own IP address,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.870
we should be able to reach our private servers from there,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.700
simply because they're in the same internal network as our Jump Box.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.090
We just need one more step.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.210
Since we are connecting from the Jump Box,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.935
we need to copy the SSH key that we use to spin up our private servers into our Jump Box,

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.540
so let's do that now.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.410
So we just logged out of our server.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.150
So we're going to go back in,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.145
but we're going to go back in with a copy command this time because we need to transfer

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:18.875
our private key so that we can use it to SSH from the Jump Box into our private servers.

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:20.470
So let's do that right now.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.705
Secure copy, the file name.

00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:31.950
Before I do that, actually I need to specify the identity which is jumpbox-key,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.860
and now I'll specify the file name.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.125
Now we need to specify where to transfer this file to,

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.940
which is ec2-user@3.17.80.159,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:55.100
and the path is going to be home/ec2-user/.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.060
It will give me the same file name,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.045
and we'll execute this command,

00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:06.435
and the files have been copied over.

00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:09.705
Let's log in to our server to verify.

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:15.850
I'll clear the screen, ls, and there's the file.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:23.360
Now we need the IP addresses of the server to make sure that we can SSH into them.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.100
Let's go back to our console and verify.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.640
Here we have our servers,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.220
I'm going to rename this for clarity so that you can see.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.385
We'll call this Private #1,

00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:38.740
we'll call this one Private #2.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.950
As you can see, these servers,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.795
they don't have an IP before public address,

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:50.990
so we need to use the internal IP address.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:58.925
In this case, let's try Private #2 which has this IP address of 10.0.1.73.

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:05.670
I'll copy the valuem and I'll come back to the console.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.520
I will do SSH,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.210
use the private key,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:17.675
and then ec2-user@, and I'll paste the address.

00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:20.065
Let's see if this works.

00:09:20.065 --> 00:09:22.875
As you can see, we get an error message.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:28.100
It requires a specific permission for our key file before we can use it.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.765
So let's change that.

00:09:29.765 --> 00:09:35.885
I'll do chmod 400, this is a private key.

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.640
This should solve the problem,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.165
and let's try the command again.

00:09:40.165 --> 00:09:43.940
I'll SSH again to the same IP address,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.670
and now we're able to log in.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.980
Let's try that with the other server to make sure it works.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.760
I'll go back to the console,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:01.270
select Private #1, and copy over the IP address.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.755
Again, I'll SSH.

00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:08.760
Actually I'll just edit this command and remove the IP address,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.400
and add the new one here, and hit "Enter".

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.790
There you are. You're able to connect to this servers that don't have

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:25.265
a public-facing IP address through the use of a Jump Box.

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:29.945
Here's some best practices to remember related to what we're doing here.

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:32.870
Be sure to restrict the access to Jump Box

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.070
only to those IP addresses that need access to it.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:42.630
Better yet, turn off your Jump Box when you're not using it for even greater security.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.355
Don't create SSH keys with your name,

00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:48.565
as they may be shared across a team.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:52.775
It's better to name them after their specific use.

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:57.995
Finally, remember that a malicious attack could come from the internal network.

00:10:57.995 --> 00:11:00.410
So apply Security Groups to

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:05.550
your private servers in the same way as if they were public servers.
