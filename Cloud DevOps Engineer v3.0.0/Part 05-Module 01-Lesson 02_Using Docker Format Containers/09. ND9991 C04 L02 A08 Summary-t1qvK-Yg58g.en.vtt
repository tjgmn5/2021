00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
All right. We've done quite a bit in our lesson today.

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.879
What we did is we set up a local development environment,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.500
and inside that development environment,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.185
we install Python and got our packages running.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.169
Next, we went through and we learned about makefiles and

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.259
how makefiles are very powerful but old

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.675
technology that allows us to put

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.205
multiple commands together and package them into a logical runner.

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:25.469
Next, we went to installing Docker.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.209
So inside of Docker,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.204
it gives us the ability to not just run docker containers but also to run Kubernetes.

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.994
Then finally, we got into Linton with Docker.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.144
So we were able to use had a lint,

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:40.640
test our Linton capabilities and then verify that they

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.899
work with a SaaS-based build provider CircleCI.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.600
Then after we got all that setup,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.715
we were able to start working on our application.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.325
What we did is we ran Docker locally and we

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.280
verified that we can install bash and run bash

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.859
and get a Ubuntu running and then verify that

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.344
those Python packages were actually installed in that container.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:05.090
Then the final step was to go through and take a customized

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.350
container that we built,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:10.250
deployed it to Amazon ECR and then verify that we're able

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.855
to actually upload that,

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.590
and it's now living in our Container Registry.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.990
What's powerful about this is it now allows us to deploy

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:21.259
that container into thousands of nodes and actually reach

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.850
a scale and also a reliability that previously didn't exist before

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:31.509
containers were a widescale technology that's been used in the marketplace.
