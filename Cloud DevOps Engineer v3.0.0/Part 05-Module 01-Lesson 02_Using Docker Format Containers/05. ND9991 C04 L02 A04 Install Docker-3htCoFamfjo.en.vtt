00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.335
Okay. Now that we have an environment set up,

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.110
we also have our makefile set up,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.745
we've tested things locally,

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.670
let's go to the next phase and install Docker itself,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.520
which we've already talked about has this powerful level

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.180
of building abstractions around applications.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.550
So in order to install Docker,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.505
we're going to need to go in and download it from their website.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.560
Let's go ahead and do that. All right.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.500
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to install Docker.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.070
I'll go to their website docker.com.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.435
Now, I'm going to say go ahead and get started.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:39.795
From here, I can go and I can download

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:45.370
a desktop Docker binary and actually install it on my machine.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.210
So if you notice here,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.840
one of the first things it's going to ask us to do is actually create an account.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.549
So if you haven't created an account,

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.575
this is when you would need to go ahead and do that.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:55.755
Since I already have an account,

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:59.580
I'm going to go ahead and sign in. Here we go.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.399
Okay. Now that we've signed into Docker,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.875
what I'm going to do is download the Docker desktop binary and install it.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.560
It's over here on the right, download Docker desktop.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.820
Once I click on it, it gives me the option to go through and run all these setup steps.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.765
First, there's download; second, there's clone;

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:21.640
third there's build; fourth,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.460
there's run; and fifth, there's ship.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.355
I'm going to go through all those steps on our own.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:29.765
So I'm going to go ahead and select "Download Docker Desktop for Mac".

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:35.490
Great. What that's going to do is it's going to download this locally to my machine.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.635
Once this is downloaded,

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:43.475
all I have to do is go through and set up and install. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:47.214
Okay. Now that the Docker binary has been installed,

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:51.110
you can double-check that it's working if you go up here in your menu bar,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.645
and you see Docker desktop is running,

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:56.825
and also Kubernetes is running as well.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:00.170
So those are two options that you can select when you install Docker.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.185
From here, you can actually see there's something called Kitematic.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:05.430
You can restart Docker,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.875
you can quit Docker desktop.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.290
So you have a bunch of different options that you should be aware of,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.990
but one of the main things is just be aware that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.490
this green icon here needs to be running or else the Docker demo is not running.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.285
Now, let's do the final step and let's actually check it from the terminal.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:23.315
So I'm going to go and I'm going to select my terminal again,

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:27.545
and then I'm going to go here and run Docker version.

00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:31.025
So as long as this works, there we go.

00:02:31.025 --> 00:02:34.830
We know that Docker is running and is installed locally.
