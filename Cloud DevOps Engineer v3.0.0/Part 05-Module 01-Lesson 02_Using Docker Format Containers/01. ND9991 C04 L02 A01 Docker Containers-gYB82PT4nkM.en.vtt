Hello. My name is Noah Gift and I'm the founder of Pragmatic AI Labs.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:07.080
I wrote the book, Pragmatic AI: An Introduction

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.700
to Cloud-Based Machine Learning,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.240
as well as the book, Python for DevOps by O'Reilly.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.265
I lecture at Northwestern,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.530
UC Berkeley, and UC Davis.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.560
Today, I'm going to discuss using Docker format containers.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.430
Let's get started.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.970
Docker containers are a really powerful concept.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
What they are is serverless technology that enables you to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.985
do a different level of abstraction that you're used to doing normally.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:40.035
In a nutshell, what is a container? Why would I use it?

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:42.305
Well, it's just like a virtual machine.

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.120
But in the case of a container,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.800
it's a single purpose.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.560
It also allows you to package code in all of the dependencies in one bundle.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.460
Another feature of containers is that they take up less space

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.330
than a virtual machine.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.570
So a virtual machine could let's say take a gigabytes of space.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.290
A container can take a let's say a 100 megabytes of space.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.430
One other distinction between a container and a virtual machine is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.450
that multiple virtual machines can run on the same local host.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.865
So in the case of a virtual machine,

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:18.170
that's really dedicated to a particular instance.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.865
Maybe you can run a couple.

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:21.050
But in the case of containers,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.380
you could run many many different containers

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.200
because of the size and also how lightweight they are.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.000
Containers are really about having many apps running on one host versus

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.265
one virtual machine or one host that runs in application in the pre-Cloud era.

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:44.250
Additionally, containers are portable.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.680
So what this does is it allows an app to move from one host to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.375
another host and that abstraction is basically hidden away from the developer.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.450
Another thing that's interesting about containers is that they're

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.270
more flexible abstractions than virtual machines.
