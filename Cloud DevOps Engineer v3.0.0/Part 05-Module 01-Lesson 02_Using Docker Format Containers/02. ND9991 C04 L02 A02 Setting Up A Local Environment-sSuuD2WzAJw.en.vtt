00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's go ahead and set up a local environment

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.669
so that we can get started with using containers.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.794
Let's go ahead and demo setting up a local environments.

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:14.800
What I'm going to do first, is I'm going to make a package called local environment.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.340
I'm going to cd into this local environment.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.679
Now I'm going to go ahead and run this command

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.195
python3 -m venv venv and create a virtual environment.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:31.655
So what this does is it isolates python so that it's located just in this directory.

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:35.950
Now to use it, I'm going to first show you my existing Python.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.195
So if I say which python3, you can see that it's in user local band python3.

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.170
That's a problem if I want to work on multiple applications.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.465
So I need to make sure I use this virtual environment that I set up.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:52.550
To do that, I run source venv/bin/activate,

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.109
and now after I run which python3,

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.839
you can see that it's located in my virtual environment.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.805
From here, the next step is,

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:04.625
I'm going to want to install a few packages to get me started.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.890
So the first package I'm going to install is,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.140
I'm going to do a pip install pylint.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.030
Pylint is a package that links your Python code

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.489
and ensures that it's syntactically correct.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.170
Another thing I'm going to run,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.140
is I'm going to do a pip install upgrade pip.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.400
So I want to make sure I have the latest version of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.380
the pip package installer. There we go.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:32.304
Once that's done, what I'm going to do is,

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:36.320
I'm going to install Python black which is a source code editor.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:45.309
Pip install black. What this does is it reformats your code

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.670
so that it complies with the latest Python standards.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.230
Then finally, I'm going to install Pytest which is a commonly used testing framework.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.640
Pip install pytest. Great. At this point,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.604
now I have a local environment setup that I can install and test Python.

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:13.884
Probably one last thing that is a nice finishing touch is to install IPython.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:18.039
So if I do pip install ipython,

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.569
that'll also give me an interactive interpreter

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.900
that's richer than the regular Python interpreter.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.299
Great. Now I can test this out,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.035
and say ipython and then from here,

00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:41.699
I can do import os.listdir just to make sure everything is working.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.754
Great. Everything looks like it's working.

00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:49.650
Now I can go on and move on to my docker container setup.
