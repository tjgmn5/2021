00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.450
Prometheus is known as a pull system rather than a push system.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.420
That means, that it knows about the data sources and pulls in their time-series data.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.325
A push system, on the other hand,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.570
does not know anything about its data sources until they send something.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.390
I prefer push systems for the simple reason that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.285
it's easier to know when a data source goes down.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:26.490
However, most of the differences between

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.780
push and pull systems are not really significant enough to worry about.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.240
Data is pulled from various data sources using light-weight agents called

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.375
exporters that are installed on or attached to data sources themselves.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.800
Data is pulled or scraped,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.174
as they say, from exporters every few seconds.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:48.035
Exporters are not hard to build,

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:53.490
but there are a lot of pre-build exporters available for most of the popular systems.
