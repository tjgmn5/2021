00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.985
You now know how to manually configure an instance with node exporter.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.390
It's a similar process to get almost any exporter running,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.185
which should be really encouraging since this one was pretty simple.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:15.345
You also got Prometheus setup with

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:20.610
automatic service discovery so that it will automatically monitor EC2 instances.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.940
Nice. In this exercise you did quite a lot.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.005
Let's actually walk through it one more time and see how you did.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.345
We're going to create a new instance.

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:35.800
Again I'm going to choose an Ubuntu instance,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.990
because that's what the instructions are using.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.235
Again, I'll select a free instance with t2.micro.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:51.470
Again I want to make sure that the VPC is the default.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.500
I'm checking to make sure that I have the right amount of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.340
storage space which in this case is still great to have eight gigabytes.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.855
I'm going to add a name,

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:06.250
which this time is going to be a Prometheus Node Exporter.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.980
I put that in the wrong place,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.180
let's put that here.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.160
I'm going to create another tag just to help me categorize things a little bit better.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.170
I'm going to choose

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.250
the security group that I chose before because it has all the right ports that I want,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.655
Review and Launch, and looks like everything's pretty good.

00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:41.040
We'll launch and we'll choose my Prometheus key pair.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.195
Now we'll be able to access our new instance, Prometheus Node Exporter.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:59.205
Here is my host name right here below that I can copy,

00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:04.205
and even though it says it's pending out but I can still access this instance.

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:11.135
So now let's SSH into this instance using the Prometheus pem file.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:14.900
As before we will use the Ubuntu username,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.750
and we'll paste our host name right there in line.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.950
Now, we're in.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010
The next thing we want to do is go to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.250
the Prometheus downloads page and scroll to the node exporter section.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.970
We want to get the link address for the Linux version of our node exporter.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.640
We want to come back to our terminal,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.640
where we're logged into our node exporter EC2 instance and we want to download that file.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.830
Now we need to extract the files.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.775
Now we can go into the directory,

00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:01.325
and we can actually start up our node exporter.

00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:03.635
Again, once you see this wall of text,

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:05.980
that means something good is happening.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.230
Now we need to go in and configure

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.610
our Prometheus instance to notify it that we have a new exporter.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.830
We need to SSH into that server.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.605
When I come back to the AWS console,

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:22.350
and we're going to copy the host name once more.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.485
Now from another terminal window,

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.585
we can SSH again into

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:33.660
our Prometheus server using the Ubuntu username and pasting the host name.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.100
Now we're going to go into the directory for our Prometheus instance,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.970
and we're going to use our text editor to modify the Prometheus YML file.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.010
Once we're inside the Prometheus config file,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.520
we're going to scroll all the way to the bottom to add another scrape_config.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.665
Now I can either remove the one that's there,

00:03:57.665 --> 00:03:59.120
because it's just the default,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.490
or I can add mine to the end.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.260
I'm going to actually add mine to the end,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.215
which means I'm going to have two scrape_configs,

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:12.310
and I'm going to fix the indentation because when I pasted it,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.070
it didn't quite look right.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.585
If you don't fix the indentation, Prometheus will complain.

00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:22.465
Make sure that the indentation is correct according to YML guidelines.

00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:26.360
Here we have localhost which came from the documentation.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.130
But we don't want localhost,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.460
we actually want the host name of the EC2 instance where we have the exporter running.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.830
For that we're going to go back to AWS console and copy another host name.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.860
We're going to select our node exporter EC2 instance,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.160
and we're going to once again copy

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.670
this host name so that we can paste it back into our config file.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.955
There we have it. Now, we save and we exit,

00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:58.745
and Prometheus is now poised and ready.

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:02.220
All we have to do is start running it again.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.165
As usual the wall of text means everything's good.

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:10.580
Now let's take a look at Prometheus in

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.900
our web browser to see our new node exporter at work.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.225
Back here in Prometheus,

00:05:17.225 --> 00:05:22.700
all I've got to do is refresh and head over to Status and Service Discovery.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.175
This is going to show me my new node exporter.

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:30.140
Now you can see that I have a new type of exporter called node here,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.595
and I can click here to show more and actually see the details of my node exporter.

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:37.460
This is how we know that that node exporter is

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.820
communicating with the central Prometheus server.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.395
Now this is nice,

00:05:42.395 --> 00:05:46.790
but what if we are spinning up new servers and new instances and putting

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.320
on new node exporters all day or in an automated fashion?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.510
Having to modify that configuration file

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.035
every single time manually is just not acceptable.

00:05:57.035 --> 00:05:59.815
Let's set up automatic discovery.

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:03.320
Let's go back to our Prometheus server and actually stop

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.535
it and modify the configuration file once again.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:13.040
Again, let's scroll all the way to the bottom so that we can make a modification here.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.190
This last job that we just created was nice for

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.285
testing but is not awesome for a real production system,

00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:23.495
so let's paste in a better option.

00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:27.560
Now we have still a node job,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.940
but now it's going to be using this right here,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:38.390
ec2_sd_configs so that it can automatically find those EC2 instances and pull them in.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.425
This is EC2 service discovery configs.

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:45.520
It's a special part of Prometheus.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.745
We're going to have a region, we're going to have our access key, secret key,

00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:54.560
and the port that we should be watching for on those exporters.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.755
If you remember, we get the access key and the secret key

00:06:57.755 --> 00:07:01.525
from when we create users in IAM in AWS.

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:05.795
Make sure that the region is correct because if it's not,

00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:10.410
then service discovery will not be able to find any of your instances.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.359
Once that's done, save,

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:17.885
exit and restart Prometheus.

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:21.515
Now when you go to service discovery and refresh,

00:07:21.515 --> 00:07:26.370
you'll find many more node exporters reporting in.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.755
Now you've got outside systems that can communicate with your Prometheus service.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.740
As you add more and more exporters you'll often need to

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.935
look at tutorials to set things up the way you want.

00:07:42.935 --> 00:07:46.100
This exercise was practice in using

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.580
outside sources to configure your Prometheus instance.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.840
Using tutorials to set things up isn't cheating in fact it's normal.
