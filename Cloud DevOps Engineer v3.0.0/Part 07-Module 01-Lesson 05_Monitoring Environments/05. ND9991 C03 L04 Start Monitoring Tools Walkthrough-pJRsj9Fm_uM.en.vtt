00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.270
Since this tool is pretty useless without all three legs,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.200
most monitoring systems come with all three

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.790
built-in or at least they provide us a path to handle all three things.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.175
There are plenty of monitoring tools available.

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:19.390
Some are installable on-premises and others are Cloud-based services.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.805
Likewise, some are easier to use,

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:24.490
while others are more robust or powerful.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.645
The pros and cons are the same as with your CI/CD tools.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.055
For the rest of this lesson,

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:34.145
we'll focus on Prometheus as our monitoring tool of choice.

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:36.010
I left a list of these tools in

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.040
the lesson text below in case you want to learn more about them.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.040
I also listed which visualizer they use

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.935
since a few are built-in and others are a separate product.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:48.620
For example, Prometheus uses Grafana,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.084
which is a really slick and powerful data visualizer.

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:54.990
We're going to be focusing on Prometheus for this lesson,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.620
so I wanted to show you a little bit of what Prometheus

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.640
can do with its visualization tool, Grafana.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.945
We can keep an eye on our server in different aspects; server requests, memory,

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:09.200
CPU usage, logins, client-side,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.220
full-page loads, and network traffic.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.545
We can see how it's been doing over the past several minutes

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:18.890
and even zoom in on places that are strange.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.645
For instance, this right here,

00:01:20.645 --> 00:01:22.280
just in the past few minutes,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.235
we've had a serious drop in server requests.

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:28.890
Is it possible that something is starting to go down?

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.490
I can actually zoom in on this section and get a closer look.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.690
I can see that server requests have definitely dropped right here around 10:30.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.370
Around the same time,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.960
memory dropped as well and CPU,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.440
actually there's a peak in CPU.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.900
So we're able to see that that's actually going up.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.130
Logins went down.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.610
Here, client full-page load during this period right here, for a whole minute,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.170
it looks like there's no reporting at all from client-side full-page loads.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.030
So I'll bet the server actually went down for this period of time.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.425
There was a hiccup here.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.780
If we drill into this data even more,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.650
we might be able to find the culprit of the problem just by looking at the data.
