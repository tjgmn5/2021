00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.260
I really want to thank you for giving me the chance to

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.945
share some of my knowledge and experience with you.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.200
It's exciting to me that committed people like you are throwing

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.980
themselves into newer and better ways of solving problems.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.230
The world needs people like you,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.100
because the world's problems are only getting more and more complicated,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.525
and those problems need creative and long lasting solutions.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.810
It's my hope that the ideas that I've shared

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
here will help you to implement the right amount of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.870
automation that helps build confidence and frees up

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.560
developers to deliver value to the market with ever-increasing speed.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.480
I've got every confidence that what you've learned

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.810
here so far will help you get to the next level.
