00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.075
Once you have a steady stream of data flowing into your monitoring system,

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.635
you have a new task.

00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:09.300
Make sense of it all.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.815
But reading monitoring data can feel a bit like drinking from a fire hose.

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.969
We need something to help us not only see the current state of our systems,

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:21.570
but also see the trends and the patterns that can

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.440
help us make better decisions about tweaks in infrastructure.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.325
This is a job for data visualization tools.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:34.190
Grafana is a multi-platform open source solution for running data analytics,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.770
pulling up metrics that makes sense of the massive amount of data,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.840
and monitoring apps through customizable dashboards.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.040
Grafana works with many systems,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.595
namely Graphite and Prometheus.

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:49.235
Kibana is an open-source data visualization dashboard

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:52.865
that's part of the ELK Stack or Elastic Stack.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.460
It provides visualization capabilities on

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.600
top of the content in an elastic search cluster.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.730
Datadog is a popular cloud-based monitoring service

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.505
that not only collects and aggregates server data,

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:10.180
but it also provides many easy-to-configure data visualizations and templates.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.000
Prometheus. Prometheus doesn't attempt to implement

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.365
robust feature field data visualizations as part of its core offering.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:20.495
In fact, in the documentation,

00:01:20.495 --> 00:01:22.745
they encourage us to use Grafana.

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:25.520
But they do offer the expression browser,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.345
which allows us to experiment with formulas called expressions,

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:33.485
and produce simple line graphs for things like CPU usage,

00:01:33.485 --> 00:01:36.450
available memory, and disk space.
