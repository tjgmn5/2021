00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.480
When a problem arises,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.995
we want to know about it so we can jump in and fix the problem.

00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:10.350
Our monitoring system should send out alerts with

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.025
hints on what's going on with the server or device.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.455
With systems like Prometheus,

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.995
we have a lot of channels of communication that we can use.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.370
We can send out alerts via e-mail, chat tool,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.620
desktop notifications, phone calls,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.540
and the list goes on.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.465
Before we get into how to set up alerts,

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:34.045
let's talk briefly about how alerts can be misused.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:38.740
What happens when you've heard a constant beeping noise for several hours?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.850
You stop noticing it of course.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.205
This describes the process of desensitization.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:48.125
Did you know that that can happen with alerts from monitoring systems?

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:53.540
It's such a common thing that there's even a term for it, alert fatigue.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.770
If a team is constantly bombarded with alerts that they don't need,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.275
they begin to ignore them.

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:03.580
They've become desensitized to the alerts.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.315
They're suffering from alert fatigue.

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:08.114
When an alert sounds,

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.065
that actually is important,

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:14.355
the team doesn't even notice it and their response time is delayed.

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:17.120
What's the solution? Either send out

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.610
only important alerts or give the team

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.735
a way to filter out alerts that are not relevant to them.

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:24.990
Whatever the solution you choose,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.275
if you want your alerts to mean something,

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:30.990
make sure you avoid alert fatigue.
