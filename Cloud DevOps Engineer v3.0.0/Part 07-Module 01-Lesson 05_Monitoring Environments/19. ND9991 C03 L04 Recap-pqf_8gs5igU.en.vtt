00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.275
We've come to the end of this course.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.070
It's been a wild ride and I'm glad you stuck with it to the end.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.695
By now, you should have a very full toolbox of new and useful skills.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:18.360
I hope you're already seeing ways to start using those skills even tomorrow.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.060
Hey, maybe you're already way ahead of me and you're using

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.900
those skills in your current project.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.200
In this course, we talked a lot about the theory

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.960
and principles behind continuous delivery,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.510
continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.040
Then we put that theory to work as we talked about,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
and even built a complete CI pipeline from commit,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.235
to build, to artifact.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:46.685
Once we had CI humming,

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:49.280
we built out the entire CD pipeline,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.145
putting out more of that theory to test,

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:55.915
and then raising the tide of confidence of your Dev Team.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:01.130
Then once we had CI and CD running, building, testing,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.680
analyzing, and deploying, we built up

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.865
a monitoring system that alerted us when something failed.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:09.950
We also set ourselves up for some machine learning and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.580
data science to help us predict future failures.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.965
Wow, with all of these capabilities,

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:17.930
the world had better watch out.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.420
You're ready to take on any problem.
