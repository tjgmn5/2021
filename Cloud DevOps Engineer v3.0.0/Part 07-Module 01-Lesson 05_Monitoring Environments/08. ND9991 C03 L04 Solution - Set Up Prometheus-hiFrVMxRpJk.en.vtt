00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.310
You're now the proud owner of a Prometheus server.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.950
It may not look like much now, but just wait.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.180
Get some exporters installed and start flowing some metrics into Prometheus,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.275
and before you know it,

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.100
you'll have access to a lot of really interesting data.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.400
This little powerhouse will shine away out of the darkest holes,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.145
but until then, it will happily gather data and wait for the day that it's needed.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.770
Now that you have a Prometheus server running,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.780
you're ready to take it to the next level.
