00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.620
Budgeting is important to any business,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.585
but it can be difficult with the black box of infrastructure costs.

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:12.780
If you've ever had to prepare a budget for IT costs,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.910
you know how difficult it can be.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.625
Being honest, most of us secretly just add 20 percent to last year's budget and move on.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.030
But imagine you're putting your monitoring data to work for you.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.240
Using machine learning, you could train

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.600
a model with your infrastructure usage and cost data.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.840
That model could provide you with some educated scenarios

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.319
on your upcoming infrastructure costs based off of data,

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.630
not just an arbitrary percentage.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.500
With this accuracy, IT budgeting can become

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.765
a competitive advantage for your company instead of just an anchor that holds it back.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.710
We humans are intelligent and creative beings,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.800
and we use that intelligence and creativity to select

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.880
the matrix to watch and alert on when there's an impending issue.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.765
By default, even the most experienced Cloud developer

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.900
will keep an eye only on the matrix that he or she understands.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.765
However, there's quite a lot of other data that might be important.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:16.840
Who watches the data that we don't fully understand or view as worthy of our time?

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.040
With machine learning, a model can be trained with the breadth of

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.470
your monitoring data in order to surface

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.345
new information that might have been overlooked otherwise.

00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.630
That information could lead to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.910
faster incident resolution or prevention of incidence altogether.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.290
Of course, it doesn't take an AI to tell us that e-commerce infrastructure

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.565
needs an extra boost at the end of the year to cover holiday demands.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:47.410
But what about other temporary spikes that might happen throughout the year,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.845
month, week, or day.

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:53.360
Truth be told, even the most experienced Cloud developers

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.385
can't stay on top of all of that.

00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:57.410
On the other hand, with machine learning,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.060
a model could be trained with the last year or two of monitoring data that would

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.285
result in predictions of many upcoming spikes with uncanny accuracy.

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:11.375
This new data, coupled with automated infrastructure scaling,

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.450
would result in extremely high availability

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.115
and give your company a formidable advantage over the competition.

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:21.090
There are so many possibilities.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.670
Are you convinced yet?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.310
Well, if you're interested in learning more about

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.145
data science and gaining new capabilities to utilize your monitoring data,

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.530
I highly recommend the data scientist,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.835
Nanodegree here at Udacity.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:38.980
I left a link for you below this video in case you want to check it out.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.605
Monitoring isn't important until it is.

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.935
It's not interesting until it is.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:50.180
If you're still not convinced that you need to set up monitoring for your project,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.340
you'll just have to trust me, just do it.
