00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.425
As a cloud developer, during an outage,

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:08.535
you should be able to know where to look to find the source of the problem.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.980
You should be able to see through the haystack of

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.445
monitoring data and zero in on the issue at hand.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.140
Having some experience working through issues will help you to gain this intuition,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.345
so be patient with yourself.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:26.700
Imagine you're confronted with a mysterious issue on your first job as a cloud developer,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.355
what kinds of questions should you be asking?

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:30.825
Well, you could ask,

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:33.975
what are the alerts really trying to tell me?

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:38.370
Can I see any odd patterns in the metrics leading up to this incident?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.895
Or do the application logs want to tell me something?

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:43.990
Notice the alerts, logs,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.730
and metrics that I just mentioned had to be put there by someone in the past.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.040
Next time that person might have been you.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.120
So pay attention to and try to improve the quality of alerts, logs,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.050
and metrics so that you help the next person find the problem faster.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.405
That next person might be you.

00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:07.775
Of course, the quality of data only matters for the data that you actually have.

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:12.485
Hopefully at the moment that you need monitoring data to troubleshoot a mysterious issue,

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:13.880
you'll have enough of it.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.625
That's why experienced cloud developers often add monitoring to just about everything.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.750
Here's a list of some options.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260
The actual list would be way too long to fit on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.740
one slide and I'm sure you don't want me to read them off to you,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.010
but I'll bet you can pick out a few of the most useful ones.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.160
Operating system, application logs, services.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.855
Some might think too much monitoring data is a bad thing.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:41.255
Distraction, it's a lot of noise.

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:43.450
There's alert fatigue.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.945
There's a difference though between collecting data and acting on it.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:54.300
Here's my rule, when it comes to monitoring liberal collection, conservative reporting
