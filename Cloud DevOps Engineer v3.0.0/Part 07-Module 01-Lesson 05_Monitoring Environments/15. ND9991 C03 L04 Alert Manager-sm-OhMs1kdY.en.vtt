00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.795
Now let's actually install Alertmanager so that it knows what to do with these alerts.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.885
Now we need to go into our AWS console and get

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.545
that host name again for our Prometheus server.

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.270
Here in the AWS console,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.240
we will just copy our host name once again,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.025
and head over to the terminal and login.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:21.825
We're going to use another terminal window,

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:23.955
so that we have two running at the same time.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.405
Now we'll just SSH into our server,

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:32.800
using our PEM file and our username.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.420
Now let's create a new directory called Alertmanager.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.895
Now we need to download the Alertmanager from the Prometheus website.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:50.115
We're going to do that using Wget.

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:54.575
Before we do that, let's go and get the URL for that downloadable.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.360
Here on the Prometheus website,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.090
we're just going to find the download that corresponds

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.570
with Alertmanager for our version of Linux,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.040
copy link address, and then head back over to the terminal.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.620
Now let's Wget our URL.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.780
Now we're going to extract the file xvfz

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.090
and Alertmanager and go into that folder.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.250
Now without any configuration changes at all,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.845
we can actually start running our Alertmanager.

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:36.220
We see here that it's listening on port 9093.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.875
Let's go take a look at that port in our web browser.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:45.140
We'll just paste our URL, our host name,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.940
to our Prometheus server with port 9093 and now we see our Alertmanager.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.550
It's not really doing anything yet because it's not been configured,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.770
but it is at least accepting requests.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.870
The next step is to tell Prometheus

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.655
about our Alertmanager so they can start communicating.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:06.355
For that I'm going to go into the Prometheus configuration and make a small modification.

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:12.080
Here I'll stop Prometheus and in my favorite text editor,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.570
I'm going to make a change to the Prometheus.yml file.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.520
You've seen this before and you've been waiting for this moment,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.770
just uncomment that line,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.985
and change Alertmanager with localhost, still port 9093.

00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:30.575
Why localhost? Well, because

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:35.525
our Prometheus instance is actually the same as the Alertmanager instance,

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:36.950
and so they're on the same machine,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.345
they can both communicate just using localhost.

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.695
Save and exit.

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:47.205
Now you can start Prometheus back up.

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:51.190
If you want to take a look again at the Alertmanager,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.760
you're not going to see much,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.570
because there isn't really an alert yet to manage.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.620
Now we're going to give Alertmanager something to send out, we'll use Slack.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.010
We'll go back to Alertmanager,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.530
the terminal that we had opened for Alertmanager and we'll stop that, just for a moment.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.830
Now we're going to modify the configuration for Alertmanager.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.130
As you could guess,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.835
there's an Alertmanager.yml that we can modify.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:23.510
Now this file actually comes with some

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.230
built-in or some default settings and we don't really need any of these,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.720
so we're just going to remove all of this.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.555
Instead, we're going to paste in the configuration that's suggested by the tutorial.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:41.330
Now this time, I'm not going to try to fix

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.725
the indentation because I want to show you what happens.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.925
We'll just exit here and save,

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:51.270
and we'll try to run the Alertmanager once again.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.065
All right, so we got an error.

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.400
This is a lot of text,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.810
but what you can do,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.720
is find the place where it gives you a line number.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.090
I know it's hard to see in this wall of text,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.910
but it basically, it fails all the way down to here,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.480
loading configuration file failed and then it shows you over here,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.260
yaml line nine did not find expected key.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.750
When you see did not find expected key,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.590
probably what it means is,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.940
there was an indentation missing,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.065
a space missing and so we've got to make sure that the indentation is right on.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:26.665
Let's get back in and fix that problem.

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:33.000
Fixing the indentation is usually about two spaces,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.535
there, that's probably much better.

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.290
Let's go over this file real quick.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.470
Again, the global variables are going to be

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.530
something that affects the rest of this configuration file.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.070
Here I have a Slack API URL because I want this alert to go to Slack,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.775
and so I had to go through the instructions to go and get this web hook URL from Slack.

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:00.600
I've got a route,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.110
which shows my receiver is Slack notifications.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.690
You could have multiple routes.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.465
Then we're going to have here a list of receivers where the name is Slack notifications.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:14.105
I could change this to another name,

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.130
but it would be a different type of receiver,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.025
a different type of route.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:20.315
I'm going to stick with Slack notifications.

00:05:20.315 --> 00:05:23.060
It is actually built in so that you can send

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.895
Slack notifications without adding any new software, any new files.

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:32.010
Now I'm going to give Slack configs a channel.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.960
So if I have in my Slack channel,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.830
in my Slack team I've got a monitoring instances channel,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.880
so that means all of these notifications are going to go to that channel.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.570
Then send a resolve to just a callback that comes back

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.325
to Alertmanager to make sure that it knows that everything was fine.

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:53.370
I'm going to save this configuration and rerun Alertmanager.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.200
Listening on port 9093, all is well.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.590
Here we are again in Alertmanager and you're not going to see,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.300
again, really anything going on.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.455
Because right now we don't have any of our instances that are really suffering for RAM.

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:13.040
In order to get a good test of the Alertmanager with a Slack message,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.650
we need to give it something a little bit more controllable,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.970
like an up-time or

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:23.125
a instance app status that we can control by just turning off an instance in EC2.

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:27.600
We'll go over that just a little bit more after you finish the exercise.
