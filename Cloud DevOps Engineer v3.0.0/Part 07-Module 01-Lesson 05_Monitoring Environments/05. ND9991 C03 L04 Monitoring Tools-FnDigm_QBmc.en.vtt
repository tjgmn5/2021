00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.340
Monitoring systems are like a three-legged stool.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.250
It's not very useful if you take one of the legs away.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.185
Each leg plays an important part in realizing the system's full value.

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:16.425
The three legs are a data aggregator,

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:20.470
a data visualizer, and some time series data.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.810
A data aggregator is a system that collects and group's data by type or data source.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.350
One way to think about a data aggregator is like a database

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.000
with extra tooling to aid in data collection.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.770
Data visualizer takes copious amounts of

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.260
seemingly unintelligible data from the data aggregator,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.830
and produces useful charts and graphs that help

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.015
us understand what the data is trying to say.

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:52.070
Time series data is made up of historical data points indexed in time order.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.600
Some examples include: blood-sugar levels checked at the top of every hour,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.690
daily closing value of Microsoft stock,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.165
monthly rainfall by city,

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:05.150
available disk space by the minute.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.555
Another way I like to describe time series data is

00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:12.260
anything with a timestamp and at least 10 data points.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.025
Therefore, data collected from your monitoring system qualifies,

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.230
as long as you're saving new data with a timestamp at regular intervals.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.555
Which time series data you collect is up to you.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:28.410
How you collect it will have something to do with the aggregator you choose.
