00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.430
Let's walk through actually adding alert manager to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.625
Prometheus so that we can start sending out alerts.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:13.980
Before going too far we need to make sure that our Prometheus instance or wherever we're

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.980
going to install alert manager has port 9093 open and ready for traffic.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.475
Let's go in and take a look at that in the AWS console.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.620
Now here at the console, I'm going to select the

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.260
"Prometheus Instance" and then I'm going to scroll

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.820
this down here at the bottom in

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.450
the bottom panel and look into the Security Groups section.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.250
I see that I've got my Prometheus security group and I'm just going

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.970
to click on "View" to see the inbound rules here.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.570
I've got several ports one of them is 9093 which is the port that alert manager uses.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.960
So we're good there.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.120
Now if you need to log back in to your instance,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.680
then you should go ahead and copy

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.265
that host name once more and head on back to your terminal.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.230
I happened to have my terminal still open,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.730
so I'm just going to stop Prometheus and right here in the Prometheus folder.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.945
I'm going to add a new file,

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:10.330
I'm going to call this rules.yml.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.910
This is the file that will hold all the rules that will trigger my alerts later on.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.110
So from the tutorial,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.640
I'm just going to paste in the code that will be my rules.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.945
Now unfortunately, and as always we need to double check our yml indentation.

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:38.340
Two spaces here, three spaces there,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.490
two spaces there, comments don't really matter.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.250
That looks about right. Now, let's take a look at this file real quick.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.610
This is creating a set of groups.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.095
Each group has a name,

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:58.440
so in this case we have all instances.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.275
We're going to say the alert should

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:11.295
be using too much memory.

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:20.650
Now let's define our expression Let's say that we only want an alert when the free memory

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:30.375
is less than one million bytes and this is for one minute.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:35.890
So if for some reason a machine just takes a momentary dip down or something like that,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.585
it won't actually throw an alert unless it has been in this state for a whole minute.

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:43.105
The annotation is what is going to be in

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.680
the alert message that we are able to see later on.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.850
So this is going to say instance,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:57.255
and we'll change this to "Is almost out of memory" and of course this is critical.

00:02:57.255 --> 00:03:00.135
Save the file and exit.

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:03.320
Now we need to go into the Prometheus configuration file

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.500
and let it know that we have a new rules file.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.200
We'll just go down here to the rule files section and

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.415
simply make a small modification so that it knows about our rules yml file,

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:23.985
save the changes and exit.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:31.140
Now you should be able to start Prometheus backup with no errors.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.640
If there is an error here Prometheus will tell you,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.630
and it's probably going to be something to do with indentation of that yml file.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.070
But if you see the wall of text, it's all good.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.490
So we're back in Prometheus and now we should be able to see some alerts that are here.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.185
They're not active right now,

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:54.220
but we do see the alert showing up in Prometheus.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.275
You can actually click on this and see some of the details,

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:03.090
too much memory, almost out of memory. We're good here.
