00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.710
There will definitely be times when you need to crack

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.965
open the Prometheus configuration and make some changes.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.275
All you need to do is open up

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:15.495
the configuration YAML file in your favorite text editor and modify away.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.900
For example, you may want to change the scrape interval

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.845
from 15 seconds to 20 seconds or 60 seconds,

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:26.445
in case you are concerned about network chatter from exporters.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.770
Scraping is a lot like polling or making

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.265
requests to other systems periodically to check in.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.170
When you're ready to set up alert manager,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.020
you'll need to come back here to the configuration to add

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.770
the host name or IP address of that machine right here.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.280
You'll eventually want to set up some alert rules,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.855
which you'll define in another file and reference here by name.

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:50.270
As you build up your list of exporters,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.590
you'll need to add more and more scrape configs right here to handle each one.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.120
I only have one in my configuration file at the moment.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.930
This is where you'll also set up your automatic service discovery.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.900
That's an introduction of the Prometheus config file.
