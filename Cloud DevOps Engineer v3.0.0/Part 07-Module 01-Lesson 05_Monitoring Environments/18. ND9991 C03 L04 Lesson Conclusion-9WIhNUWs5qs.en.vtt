00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.750
Looking back in this lesson,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.220
we talked about the new capabilities monitoring gives us as cloud developers.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.270
We discussed some monitoring tools that are available.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.930
We talked about Prometheus,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.555
and we even installed and configured Prometheus.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:20.880
We talked about the various data source options and how to get that data into Prometheus.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.575
We discussed how to start analyzing and monitoring the data you have.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:29.145
Then we learned about alerts and how to set them up.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:33.240
I hope I was able to convince you of the necessity of the power of

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.550
monitoring and that you feel the burden

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.185
to implement monitoring and your next Cloud Project.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:42.675
Like I said before, it's not important until it is.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:46.220
Give your future self the gift of information,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.320
get that data stream flowing.
