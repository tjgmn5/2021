00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.615
Let's be real for moment.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.750
Monitoring isn't the most exciting topic, is it?

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.995
It's something that only feels like it's needed every now and then, and for many,

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:13.620
the volume of data feels like a scene from

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.710
the matrix where all the lines of code are blurring together.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.850
For others, there's not enough data being collected,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.380
so it never feels that useful or when it does have something to say,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.485
it's usually bad news.

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:33.110
Because of this, monitoring is often the most neglected or underestimated tools we have.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.120
But monitoring may be one of the most necessary evils of all the evils.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.800
In fact, maybe it's not so evil after all.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.170
Monitoring though often forgotten and neglected,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.710
will happily help us out of the pit of despair when we have

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.570
a server down or some mysterious application or database issue.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.245
Think for a moment about the possibilities.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:59.975
In the heat of battle, monitoring data might help you get to the problem faster.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:05.750
Network logs might help you find out when something goes down or degrades.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.285
Application logs can help you wake up the right people in the case of an incident.

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:18.575
CPU, memory and disk metrics will help you see an outage brewing even an hour before.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.290
With machine learning and data science,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.550
you could predict the next outage that could potentially happen in two weeks.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.015
Monitoring might not be the conversation piece of the century,

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:33.785
but you and your project might be if you don't have monitoring in place.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:38.400
So let's make sure that you have the knowledge that it takes to get that moving.
