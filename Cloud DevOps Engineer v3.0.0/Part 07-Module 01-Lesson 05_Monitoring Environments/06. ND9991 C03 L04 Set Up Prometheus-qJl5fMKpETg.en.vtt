00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.289
Let's walk through actually installing and setting up Prometheus on an EC2 instance.

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:12.615
So I'm here in my AWS Console and I'm going to go into EC2,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.780
and I want to scroll down to launch instance.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.865
Now, there are a lot of different AMIs,

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.340
these are called or instance types,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.550
they represent many different flavors of operating systems.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.110
I've got Amazon Linux,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.420
Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.285
I've got SUSE Linux Enterprise,

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:36.230
I've got Ubuntu, I've got a lot of different versions,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.000
even Windows is in here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.090
They have deep learning AMIs to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.165
help with just different types of data science and things like that.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:47.194
So I'm not going to try to go through all of the different types,

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:52.610
but I do want to mention that the instance type that you pick here in

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.130
the end is not going to matter a whole lot because

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.115
you're still going to end up with a Prometheus server that's running.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:01.010
You could, once you've got some expertise behind you being

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.860
able to pick any of these instance types that you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.870
have preference over or that you think is maybe

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.620
more performer or you've got some more experience with.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.705
You could pick Windows even,

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.450
you might have some trouble getting Prometheus to run on Windows,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.890
but you could actually do it,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.925
and you could do it right here in AWS EC2.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:24.455
Our tutorial that we have in the class actually is using Ubuntu.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:27.290
So we want to make sure that we pick Ubuntu at this moment,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.750
because the instructions are going to match up

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.350
with an Ubuntu server as we want to make sure that we're not getting lost there.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.570
So I'm going to search for Ubuntu right here and scroll down just a little bit,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780
because they've got some older versions in here,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.160
16 and 18, and I'm going to choose 20 because it's newer.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.605
I'm going to choose this one because it's free tier eligible.

00:01:50.605 --> 00:01:54.830
I'm also going to choose the t2 micro size,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.860
because this is also a free tier eligible,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.590
and Prometheus is a really lightweight system I don't really

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.770
need a very heavy or a very large instance type.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.390
On this screen, this is got a lot of options on it and it's maybe a little bit scary,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.355
but really all you have to do is make sure that the default VPC is set.

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:22.060
All of the other options you can leave as complete defaults.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.910
Here also the default works really well for us,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.410
because Prometheus doesn't need a lot of database or a lot of space on

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.765
the disk where it was going to keep the database

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:35.660
so we're going to stick with eight gigabytes just for right now.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.820
We can always raise that later.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.220
I like to add a tag right here.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.570
I know I could do this later on,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.315
but if I do it right here, I won't forget.

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.630
So I'm going to add a name tag with a capital N,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.760
because that is going to correspond with

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.385
the name of the instance that appears in the list.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:59.120
So I'm going to call this Prometheus Instance.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.925
So you could call that almost anything,

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:05.330
but I do encourage you to keep this name fairly descriptive.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.330
I'm also going to add another tag that helps me to know when I created this,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.130
sometimes these tags help me.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.170
So now I'm going to configure the security group.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.140
In the tutorial, you'll find that they are asking you to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.710
go ahead and add rules here to add more ports.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.494
You can also reuse

00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:30.380
a security group that you've created in the past, which I have right here.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.030
I've got one called Prometheus so mine has opened up a few ports,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.960
including 9090, which is the requirement for this demo.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.560
So now I just get to look over all of my settings and yeah,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.075
it looks like everything is pretty much good,

00:03:48.075 --> 00:03:50.244
so I'm going to click "Launch."

00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:53.255
So here I would be able to create

00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:57.595
a new key pair where I can give it a name and then I can download the key,

00:03:57.595 --> 00:04:00.050
or if I already have a key pair created,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.510
I can choose an existing key pair.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.970
So I've got one created called Prometheus,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.730
I'm going to choose that, and then I'm going to click the box that says acknowledge.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.210
So then we will launch the instance.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.770
So now that instance is launching,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.070
I can actually click here and go in and see some of its details.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.140
Here's my Prometheus Instance,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.840
it picked up that tag by the name.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.850
We can see here that it's pending,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.290
and right down here below,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.700
you've got a few interesting things,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.590
especially right here, Public DNS.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.075
This is the host name,

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.390
and here is the public IP address.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.590
If you use an IP address,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.920
that IP address actually could be pulled out from under you at any moment,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.505
because you're not guaranteed to keep the same IP address forever and ever.

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:49.470
However, the host name is something that will live for the life of this instance,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.885
it will never change.

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:53.540
So I'm actually going to copy this host name,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.955
because that's gonna be useful here in just a moment.

00:04:55.955 --> 00:05:00.380
So over here in the terminal now we want to actually go into SSH,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.830
into our Prometheus instance and EC2,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.215
I'm in my local machine in my terminal,

00:05:06.215 --> 00:05:09.800
and so I want to call ssh -i,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.870
and I'm going to give it the name of my pem file, right there.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.519
Then I'm going to give it the username of my EC2 instance.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.770
In this case, since I chose Ubuntu,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.830
I'm going to use Ubuntu as the username @,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.850
and then I'm going to paste the host name that I just copied from the AWS console.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.630
That should be enough. Once I press "Enter," then I'll get a chance to actually

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.170
login to that instance from my local machine.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.370
So now we're inside of the Ubuntu instance in AWS via SSH,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.180
you can see that my prompt has changed ever so slightly,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.700
it shows that I'm in Ubuntu IP,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.785
and there's the IP address that it has.

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:08.930
So now I'm going to actually download the Prometheus server from GitHub using wget,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.845
which is going to put this tar file in the folder where I am right here.

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:21.750
That was fast. So now I want to extract the files from that tar file,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.840
and press "Enter" to extract.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.255
Then now we have a new folder called Prometheus 2.19 all that,

00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:38.040
we will go into that folder,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.690
and from here we can actually check the version of Prometheus,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.055
and we can see that we have version 2.19 just as expected.

00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:53.650
So the default installation should have

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.875
a configuration file that we can take a look at real quick.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:01.520
So we'll say cat prometheus.yml.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.135
There's definitely a lot going on in a configuration file like this,

00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:12.745
so we won't go over everything about it right now.

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:18.910
The fact that we have a configuration file is definitely encouraging.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:25.770
So let's actually start up Prometheus so that we can access it from our browser.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.830
Once we see this wall of text in our console,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.615
we know that our server is ready.

00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:46.190
So let's navigate in our browser to the URL or

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.840
the host name for our EC2 instance with port 9090,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.610
so that we can go directly to Prometheus there it is.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.310
Prometheus is now running on our EC2 instance.
