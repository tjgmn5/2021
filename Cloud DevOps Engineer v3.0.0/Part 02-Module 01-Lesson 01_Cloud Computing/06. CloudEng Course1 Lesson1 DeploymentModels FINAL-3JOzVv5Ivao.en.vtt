00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.565
There are three Cloud computing deployment models.

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:10.720
They are public, private, and hybrid.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.844
A Public Cloud makes resources available over the internet.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.289
Resources could include servers,

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.625
databases, application development services, etc.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:30.339
Amazon Web Services or AWS is currently the largest Public Cloud provider.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.469
A Private Cloud called On-premises,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.159
is a proprietary network or an internal data center

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.789
that supplies services to a limited number of people,

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.045
and internal to a specific company.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:52.925
A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and private Cloud.

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:57.819
For example, PII or Personally Identifiable Information

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.228
about customers may be stored in an On-premise database for security reasons,

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:06.935
while a web application to manage that data may be served

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:11.689
publicly with orchestration and communication between the two.
