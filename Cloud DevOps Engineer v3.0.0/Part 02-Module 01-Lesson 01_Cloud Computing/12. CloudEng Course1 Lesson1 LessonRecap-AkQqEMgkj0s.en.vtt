00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
In this lesson, I introduced you to the basics of cloud computing,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.144
discussing characteristics like pay as you go and

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:12.359
auto-scaling where resources grow and shrink on demand.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.599
I taught you about the serverless concept which simply

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.335
means that the cloud provider manages servers for you.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:24.530
We discussed the AWS and its global infrastructure containing regions,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.095
AZs, and edge locations.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:30.109
I highlighted the shared responsibility model.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.049
Remember, AWS is responsible for security of the Cloud,

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.589
we are responsible for security in the Cloud.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.280
Next, I will teach you about servers and compute power in the Cloud.
