00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Hello, I'm Kesha Williams.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:05.849
I've been in the IT industry for over 20 years.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:10.455
I've taught technical courses at the university level for over 11.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:14.009
I currently serve as a software engineering manager,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.500
leading and mentoring engineers as they build next-generation cloud applications.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.644
I've worked on multiple projects to migrate legacy applications to the cloud,

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:28.259
using Amazon Web Services, AWS.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.335
I hold several AWS certifications,

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.995
and I've helped countless others achieve certification.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.179
I routinely lead innovation teams to research

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:43.774
cloud AI services and was recently named an Alexa Champion by Amazon.

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:47.299
I'm thrilled to be on this cloud journey with you.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.739
So let's get started.
