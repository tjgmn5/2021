Let's navigate to the AWS product page.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.230
I've navigated to the AWS product page.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.804
AWS offers a broad set of global base products.

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.234
Let's look at the different categories.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:17.699
First, there's analytics for big data.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.424
It also offers visualization tools like Amazon Quicksight,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:26.385
querying tools for objects or files like Athena,

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:29.075
and redshift for data warehousing.

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:31.879
There's also application integration.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.149
So there are services like the Simple Queue Service.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.659

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.944
There's also AWS cost management tools, like AWS budgets.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:51.145
There's also compute services like EC2 that provides virtual servers.

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:55.460
AWS Lambda for running code in a serverless fashion,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.634
and in response to events.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:01:01.969
Elastic Beanstalk for running web applications.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.935
There are also database management services for engines like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:14.855
There's even support for NoSQL databases like Dynamo DB,

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:19.225
and even document-based databases like MongoDB.

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:23.204
There are developer tools like AWS Cloud9,

00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:25.230
which is a cloud IDE.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.510
There's AWS Code Pipeline for continuous integration.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.030
There are also security services.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.945
So there's KMS, Key Management Service for data encryption.

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:40.424
AWS Shield, for DDoS protection.

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:46.795
Identity and Access Management or IAM for fine grain control over permissions.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:52.805
There are also additional services like Blockchain services, Machine Learning,

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:56.630
Computer Vision, IoT, Internet of Things,

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.049
and AR, and VR services.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.375
Now, we will not cover all of these services,

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:07.870
just the more foundational services: popular storage and content delivery services,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.750
networking, security, and messaging services.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.879
All of the basic building blocks that you'll need for Cloud-based Applications.
