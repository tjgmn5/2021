00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.259
When developing applications and providing services to our users or customers,

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.359
we are in a shared responsibility model with AWS,

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.669
and that is what this diagram shows.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.719
AWS is responsible for security of the Cloud.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.740
We are responsible for security in the Cloud.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.259
So for example, what that means,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.675
AWS provides us the security tools to protect our data but

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:34.020
we retain control of what security tools we choose to implement to protect our systems.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.395
The orange portion of this diagram shows what AWS is responsible for,

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:43.460
things like hardware, things like database,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.000
storage, regions, availability zones.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920
In the blue portion,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.969
this shows what customers are responsible for.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.329
So things like our customer data,

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.969
the firewall configuration, server-side encryption, etc.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.704
So when we think about who is responsible for what,

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:10.310
we are responsible for security in the Cloud while AWS

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.170
provides us the tools that we need in order to secure our systems.
