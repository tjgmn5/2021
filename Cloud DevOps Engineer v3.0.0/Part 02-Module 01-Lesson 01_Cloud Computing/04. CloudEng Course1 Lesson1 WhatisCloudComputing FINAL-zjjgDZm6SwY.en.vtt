00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.330
Cloud computing involves the delivery of IT resources such as databases,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.824
compute power, application, security,

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:15.344
etc, over the Internet.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.125
There are three characteristics of Cloud computing.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:24.795
Pay-as-you-go, autoscaling, and serverless.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:29.820
Pay-as-you-go which means there are no long-term contracts,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.100
and you pay only for what you use.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.079
Sometimes you pay by the minute,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.600
hour, or even second.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000
Autoscaling simply means resources that grow

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.899
or shrink or automatically scale based on demand.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.879
Servers can be provisioned almost instantly so that you don't have to guess

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.054
about capacity or make huge capital investments in servers upfront.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:59.644
I'm sure you've heard the term serverless in relation to the Cloud.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:04.400
This simply means that a Cloud provider manages the servers for you.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.745
You, as the developer, simply write code.

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:10.760
The Cloud provider executes that code on

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.780
some server somewhere and you're not concerned with that aspect.
