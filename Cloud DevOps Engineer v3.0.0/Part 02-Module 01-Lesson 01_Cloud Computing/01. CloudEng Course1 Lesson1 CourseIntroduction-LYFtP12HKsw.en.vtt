00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Welcome to Cloud Fundamentals,

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:04.259
my name is Kesha Williams.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm sure by now you've heard about the Cloud and its awesome benefits.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.009
The Cloud has become a key enabler for

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.390
innovation with beneficial features like high availability,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.274
unlimited capacity, and on-demand scalability.

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:21.239
If you're a big organization,

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.909
you'll see cost savings when you no longer

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.149
have to run and maintain your own internal data center.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.278
Not only will you save money,

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:31.679
but your engineers can now focus on that

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.710
which differentiates your business from the competition.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.130
Or maybe you are a software developer with

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.010
the next big innovative idea and you need to

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.159
quickly stand up your idea and just try it out.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.409
Well, the Cloud will benefit you.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.584
In this course, I will teach you the fundamentals of Cloud computing.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:51.380
While learning the fundamentals,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.090
you will explore the tools and services offered by Amazon Web Services,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.140
AWS, through interactive hands-on exercises.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.600
We will start with an overview of the Cloud and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.420
its benefits in the Cloud computing section.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.835
Next, servers in the Cloud and the foundational and compute services section.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:14.390
Then I will teach you about storage and databases in the Cloud,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.394
during the storage and content delivery section.

00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:22.924
Then we will discuss how to secure your Cloud applications in the security section.

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:26.099
Then we discuss networking, auto-scaling,

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:30.204
and load balancing in the networking and elasticity section.

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:32.864
Next, I will teach you about messages,

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:36.659
cues, and containers in the messaging and Containers section.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.890
Then we wrap up with services that help you manage

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.670
your Cloud environment in the AWS management section.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.500
By the end of this course,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.430
you will have deployed your first application to AWS.
