There are three types of Cloud Computing.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.740
Infrastructure as a service,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.960
infrastructure as a service,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.834
platform as a service,

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.830
and software as a service.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.844
Infrastructure as a service is when the provider supplies a Virtual Server instance,

00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:26.129
storage and mechanisms for you to manage the servers.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:30.644
Examples include Amazon Web Services or AWS,

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:36.759
Rackspace, Digital Ocean and Iron Mountain etc.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.500
Platform as a service.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.179
This is when development tools are provided

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.079
that are hosted on a provider's infrastructure.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.769
So they manage the hardware and operating system.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.265
You focus on managing and deploying applications.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:58.855
Examples of this are GoDaddy, salesforcesforce.com etc.

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:01.404
Software as a service,

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:04.219
this deliver software applications over

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.525
the Internet that are run and managed by the service provider.

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:15.670
