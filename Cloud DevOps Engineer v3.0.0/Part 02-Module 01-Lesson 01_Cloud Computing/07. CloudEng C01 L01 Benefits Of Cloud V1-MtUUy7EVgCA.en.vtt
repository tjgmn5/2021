00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.774
Personally, as a software engineer,

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:07.575
the biggest benefit I've seen is the ability to innovate quickly.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.925
I can develop an application and put it in the hands of millions on

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.115
a global scale with great performance in a relatively short period of time.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.279
I also have the ability to fail fast.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.140
That is, try an idea and put it out there quickly to see if it's going to work,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.234
which is great when you have a lot of innovative ideas to try out.

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:33.390
There are several additional benefits to Cloud computing.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.439
You don't have to guess about capacity and make huge capital investment upfront.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.015
You pay for only what you need and use,

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:47.539
and you can quickly go global with good performance with lower latency

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.950
since content can be delivered from locations close to your user base.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.755
Now latency is just the time it takes to receive a response once a request is sent.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:04.350
You can also deliver more quickly since you don't have to stand up and manage servers.
