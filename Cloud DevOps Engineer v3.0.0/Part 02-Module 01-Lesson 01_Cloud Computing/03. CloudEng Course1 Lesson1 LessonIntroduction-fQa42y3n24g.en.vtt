Imagine, you want to start your own travel blogging website.

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:08.804

You've heard about the benefits of the Cloud,

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:14.519
like access to unlimited computing power,

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.259
security and storage, and you'd like to try it out for your website.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.235
Well, the Cloud is the perfect place to host your website.

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:26.239

let's talk about the basics of Cloud computing,

including Cloud deployment models,

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:38.840
benefits and popular options.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.710
