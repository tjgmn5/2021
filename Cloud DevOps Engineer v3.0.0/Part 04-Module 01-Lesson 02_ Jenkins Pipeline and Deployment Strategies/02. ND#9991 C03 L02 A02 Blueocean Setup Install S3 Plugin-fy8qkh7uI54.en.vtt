00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.705
All right. So S3 Jenkins setup.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.765
What we need to do is,

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:12.089
we need to configure our Jenkins environment so that it has

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.355
the correct package to be able to copy something into S3.

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.310
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.789
We're going to start with clicking on, "Manage Jenkins."

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.550
Next we're going to go into our "Plug-in manager."

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.740
Now, let's go ahead and click on "Available."

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.025
You're going filter with

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:49.920
AWS and we're going

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.060
to select, "Pipeline AWS steps."

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.469
This is going to give us a whole lot of stuff.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.278
Great. So let's go ahead and just restart

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:18.189
Jenkins and we're going to actually do this step from the command line.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.030
It frequently crashes inside of the GUI there.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.179
So let's go ahead and log in again.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.830
Good. So now we've got our plugin

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.310
installed and we can go ahead and move on the next step.
