00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.325
Now we're looking at how to segregate your environments.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:08.460
So you are going to be developing your code

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.880
and that most normally be done in a development environment.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.089
Then when you have QA engineers test it,

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.390
you want to do that in a staging environment.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.734
That's because you don't want to overwrite what they're doing.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.600
So you want to allow them to do

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.365
their testing work and yet you still be able to develop your code.

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:31.409
Otherwise, they couldn't get 400 level errors or

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.000
500 level errors that will make them go several steps back and be like,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.215
"Well, what's going on here?"

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:42.490
So let's go ahead and look at how this works, jumping right in.
