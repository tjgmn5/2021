00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.385
So folks, we are going to do a little story time,

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:12.555
and this comes down to the choices that you make as a DevOps engineer.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.190
Working late one Friday night at a startup long, long ago,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.535
I decided to make a manual change

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:24.185
on a couple of servers that were behind a load balancer,

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:26.275
and I fixed the problem.

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:30.945
Then Q8 checked it on Monday morning.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:32.670
Then they did a new deploy,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.290
which over those manual changes,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380
and they checked it again and it stopped working.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.130
So my boss being a smart lady that she was,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.025
she very quickly realized what the problem was and was like,

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.125
"Owen, please don't do that".

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.110
So I just encourage you to learn from

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.375
my mistake and don't make manual changes on production.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:57.300
Already, let's move on to the next lesson.
