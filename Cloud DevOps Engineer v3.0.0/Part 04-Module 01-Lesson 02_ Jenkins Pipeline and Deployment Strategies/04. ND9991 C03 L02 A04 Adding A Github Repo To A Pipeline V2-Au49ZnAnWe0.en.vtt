00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
Wonderful, so now we have our S3 plugin installed and configured,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.615
and we're ready to go about setting up Blue Ocean with GitHub.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:16.270
So let's click on Open Blue Ocean.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.785
It's going to prompt us that this is the first time.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.785
So go ahead and create a new pipeline,

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.730
and it gives us five options by default.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.340
Let's choose GitHub.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.320
Very helpfully says create an access token here and this

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.840
is wonderful,because as long as you are still logged in to GitHub,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.020
it will recognize that,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.875
and we can do that auto-magically.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:49.750
Click on "Generate token".

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.155
Wonderful.

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:57.840
Let's put that information into Jenkins,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.140
and connect, and it sees my GitHub repositories.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.980
We're going to select it. Create pipeline.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.320
Great. So now we have configured to talk to GitHub,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.210
and we can go about working with a branch.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.720
Let's go into master and let's see what is giving us.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.910
So we're going to kick off a build here.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.305
Great. So we have successfully built our pipeline

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:59.795
and what was incorporated in this was uploading into S3.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.800
So we did a deployment,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.960
and it wasn't a continuous deployment,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.435
but it was a successful deployment into S3.

00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:16.145
Now we're going to go ahead and take a look at the other half of CI/CD nomenclature.

00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:17.630
We're going to start looking into

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.880
continuous integration and some of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.070
the components that are involved in that in the next lesson.
