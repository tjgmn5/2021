Hey, good job. All right,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.105
so we've just finished up with our multiple environments here.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.840
What I want you to keep in mind is that these are all

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
just suggestions of what other organizations use,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
but for your specific company it may be that you need to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
have many more environments than what we're using in this example set.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.540
So tailor it to whatever the business processes

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.435
that's going to make that work best for you.

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:33.310
So let's move on in and get down a little deeper with pipelines.
