00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
Okay. We're going to get into testing here and we're

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.413
going to do it just with something that's really easy to verify,

00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:13.724
and that's just bear HTML, Hypertext Markup Language.

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:16.108
So to start this out,

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.600
we have to go to our command line prompt,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.440
and we're going to APT install tidy,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.150
you're going to need root privileges.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.899
So make sure you run this as pseudo if you're not ready,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.109
and we'll type Yes to install it.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.320
Then we'll go about putting the package onto our system.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.759
So now, we're going to go ahead and use our development pipeline,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.125
we'll go into just using the classic Jenkins interface for a second.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.070
Do scan repository now,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.820
and so we'll just check to see if there are any changes.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.350
It's building because we've just recently made

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.879
a commit and we need to fix this particular bug.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.474
So first, we'll just take a look at the error real quick.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.574
We see down here,

00:01:11.575 --> 00:01:17.590
line six call mono six replacing unexpected script with /script.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.844
Let's take a look.

00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:27.995
So we come over here and to our git repository and we'll take a look at index at HTML,

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:35.645
and we see that there are two strong tag or three strong tags and one script tag.

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:44.409
So let's change this fourth script tag into a strong tag.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.465
We're going to check out a new branch.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:02:00.840
So git checkout -b fix_ html_ tag.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.390
We're going to add everything into

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.960
this new branch that we have here and we're going to commit it all.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.950
Great. So now, we can go ahead and just push this branch into

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:31.685
our repository and we can let somebody else review that pull request once it comes up.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.634
But because we're the only one,

00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:36.185
we'll end up actually just merging our own pull request.

00:02:36.185 --> 00:02:41.284
So git _push_ tag_ name,

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:49.859
but branch name, origin.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.739
Okay. So let's go into GitHub and take a look at that.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.509
Now, we have our new pull request.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.510
One of the beautiful things is it['s actually performing steps right within here as well.

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:39.179
So we'll go ahead and merge it.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.800
This takes the code from our branch and puts it into master.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.929
So now we're going to come back to our pipeline.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.840
We're just going to go ahead and do scan repository now.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:20.215
Great. So now we see it's past the tidy step and it's uploaded to S3.

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:23.989
Wonderful. Let's look a little bit more deeply into

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.560
additional things that we can do for the code verification step.
