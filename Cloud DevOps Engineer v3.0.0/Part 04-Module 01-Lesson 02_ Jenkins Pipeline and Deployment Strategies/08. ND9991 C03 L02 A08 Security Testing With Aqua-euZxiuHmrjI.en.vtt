00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
First we need to get the MicroScanner Aquasec set up.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:07.170
So let's go to that website and register for a token.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.250
We click the check box and then we put it in our email address and click on

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.225
Register and we'll get an email shortly.

00:00:16.225 --> 00:00:21.995
Now we come back to Jenkins and we're going to go into the Plugin Manager yet again

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:28.220
and in the available we check the Aqua MicroScanner and install without restart.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.025
We'll click that and wait for a minute.

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:34.620
We see the pending interface there and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.405
it's just going to go ahead and pull that for us and we get a success.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.890
So that's great.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.855
Now we need to go about installing Docker.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.910
So we install Docker.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.205
Great. So now we need to give Docker and Jenkins symbiotic permissions.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:09.000
We do that and we'll come back to our Jenkins web interface.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.125
So now we need to actually restart

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:30.090
our Jenkins so that the changes that we made with our Aquasec can take effect.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.920
Every time we restart we have to reload here.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.530
So just takes a minute while all the library files are loaded up.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.950
Great. So let's login.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.530
Okay. So we're freshly locked in,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.805
now we have to go about configuring the Aquasec first of all.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:07.090
So the email message that we should have just recently received we need to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.580
configure Aquasec to have

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.220
the credentials to have the security token so that it can talk to Aquasec.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.455
So we'll go to the section that says

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:24.355
aqua MicroScanner and you will just fill out your security token.

00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:29.580
Come right on back and paste that buddy in there and now we're just going to hit

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.140
apply and that's going to make it immediately

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.215
take effect and we've already restarted Jenkins.

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:43.380
So now we need to set up things for Docker.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.545
Let's go into global tool configuration and we're just going to search for Docker.

00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:54.705
We're going to click on Docker installations

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:58.680
and we're going to set an installation root path

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.000
and we're going to set our version number for

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.170
the name and then we're just going to go ahead and click apply.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:19.380
Wonderful. Okay. So now

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.935
we have Aquasec installed,

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:27.670
we've got Docker installed and we can switch over to Blue Ocean.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.410
So we're going to go into our development branch

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.880
and we see we have a failed previous build.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.835
We're just going to try that one more time.

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:42.040
We're going to open up that build in

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.975
the lower right hand corner and then it's going to show us our pipelines.

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:52.870
So we see start and build security scan, upload AWS.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.975
So if we click on the arrow,

00:03:55.975 --> 00:04:01.940
we're Aqua MicroScanner as we can see the console output as it's running that we see

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.615
MicroScanner in progress and that went by really quickly and uploaded to S3.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:13.100
Great. So that means that passed and

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.810
we've successfully demonstrated security testing with aqua.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.800
We've installed the Jenkins plug-in.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.045
We've installed Docker.

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:26.465
We've configured Jenkins to use Docker.

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:33.420
We've restarted Jenkins and we also added a build step for Aqua security.
