Hi guys, welcome back.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.220
We are now jumping right into Blue Ocean.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.085
Come on in the water is fine.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:17.910
Blue Ocean is a skin job for Jenkins and it doesn't really change the core functionality,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.025
it just presents it in a different way and you can always switch back and forth between

00:00:23.025 --> 00:00:26.010
the Jenkins classic interface and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.895
Blue Ocean or any other plug-in that you see appropriate for what you're doing.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:36.425
So we'll be learning Blue Ocean here but if you find something better that you prefer,

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:38.870
that's certainly what you should do.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.845
It also gives you some built-in diagnostics as well

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:47.435
which we'll address in much deeper fashion later on in the lesson.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:51.300
All right, let's dive in folks.
