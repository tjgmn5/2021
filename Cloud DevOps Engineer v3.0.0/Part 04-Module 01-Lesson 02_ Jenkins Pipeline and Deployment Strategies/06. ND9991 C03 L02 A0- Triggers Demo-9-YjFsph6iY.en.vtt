00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.430
All right. So now we've done our deployment,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.910
let's look at how we can trigger something to happen automagically.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.140
Specifically, what we're concerned about is how to

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.010
make it so that it can continuously check GitHub and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.115
see if the information in GitHub has changed

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:27.585
versus the cached storage information which is on Jenkins.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:32.465
So to do this we're going to exit out of Blue Ocean.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.030
You'll notice in the top right-hand corner you have

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.810
logout and then you have an arrow inside of a square.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.310
We're going to click on that arrow and we're gonna go ahead and click on

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.430
Blue Ocean to get inside of that branch and we're going to click on Master.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.080
We're going to click on Blue Ocean and we're going to click on

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.510
configure and what we are concerned about is the scan repository triggers.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.650
So in the top middle of the screen click on that Skinner repository

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.255
triggers and we have a checkbox periodically if not otherwise run.

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:22.100
So you're going to select that and you're going to change the dropdown.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.780
Let's select something a little bit more aggressive. About one minute.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.100
It's just our server.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.915
So we're not particularly concerned about making the experience bad for anybody else.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:36.390
So we'll go ahead and click on apply.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.630
Great. So now we've set it up so that anytime that new information is pushed out to Git,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.690
it will attempt to do something with that information, i.e., built. Okay.
