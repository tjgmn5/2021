00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
Now, let's dive in a little deeper with pipelines.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.990
The main feature that we're concerned with right now is

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.410
how you push off a continuous integration.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.449
The way that works in practice is with a trigger.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:24.269
This is very fundamental to the way that you do this action and it involves

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.410
modifying things both in your GitHub repository and in

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.355
your Jenkins interface so they can both kill each other off like,

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:38.449
"Hey, I've got this new branch has been pull requested" or "Hey,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.380
I've taken this branch and I've built a new job."

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.510
So there's this give-and-take that goes on between those components and that's

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:52.820
really what we're going to focus in on how to set this up correctly.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.009
So let's go and see how this works in the Jenkins interface.
