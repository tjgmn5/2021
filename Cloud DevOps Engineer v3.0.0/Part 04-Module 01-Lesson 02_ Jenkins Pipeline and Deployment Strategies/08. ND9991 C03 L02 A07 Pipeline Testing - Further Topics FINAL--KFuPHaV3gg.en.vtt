00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
Just for the sake of completeness,

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:07.979
it's necessary that we discuss a couple of topics that we're not going to go in depth on,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.950
but you should be fully aware of their implications.

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.814
The first is performance testing.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:22.289
That is because this is a much more complex subjects that can take a long time.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.730
Then we are going to be able to cover in this lesson here.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.260
With performance testing, you're basically bringing up an environment,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.844
to usually a scale down level of an environment,

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:41.600
and then using agents which will test that environment to see what kind of load handling,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
how many users connected or transactions per second,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.505
or whatever it is you're measuring that environment is capable of.

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:53.554
Then, another thing that we're not doing but it's

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:58.820
definitely something that you will encounter in your workplace is integration testing.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.125
This is where you are adding your code to

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.379
a larger project and you're testing to see

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.920
when you make a change here and you deploy everything,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.534
does that break the application as a whole?

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:19.200
But I think that being able to cover

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.064
the component parts of testing the functionality with lynching,

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:28.120
you will understand how this stuff works,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.510
and you'll be able to scale this to what it is that you're trying to accomplish.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.088
So we've covered lynching,

00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:38.825
we've covered security testing, performance testing.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:40.505
You can go find out on yourself,

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:42.159
as well as integration testing.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.950
Already, let's move on.
