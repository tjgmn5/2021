00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Now, I'm going to show you a storage bucket.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.669
There's a reason for it.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm going to find the component here.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.785
You see, is it s3 bucket?

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.054
Let's see, yes.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:22.785
So the s3 bucket,

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:28.870
I need to put it outside of your PCC.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:36.739
Now, the reason why I'm putting it outside of your PCC is because AWS provide services,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.350
s3 is a storage service where you can store

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.469
files that your applications are going to use such as;

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.825
images, video, HTML files, and similar.

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:51.200
But keep in mind, this is a service, a public service.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.900
So this is going to reside outside of your private cloud context.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.229
So what that means is if you need to access this bucket,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.534
this storage bucket from within your private subnets

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:08.269
you have to have those NAT gateways so that they can access the Internet,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:11.838
because even though you're still inside Amazon,

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.879
it still has to go to

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:18.274
the outside public Internet and send traffic to be able to reach this bucket.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:23.870
So when you're doing diagrams that's a situation where you're going to see a bucket that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.170
is placed outside of the containers and you wonder, "Why is it outside?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.670
Should I not put it in the PCC?"

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.890
Well, the reason is you can not put it inside

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.174
the PCC because it's a service that they provide to you.

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:39.140
So keep that in mind,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.060
that's why we need Internet traffic to be available for

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.655
the private subnets because you have to reach things that are

00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:50.460
outside of the normal context.
