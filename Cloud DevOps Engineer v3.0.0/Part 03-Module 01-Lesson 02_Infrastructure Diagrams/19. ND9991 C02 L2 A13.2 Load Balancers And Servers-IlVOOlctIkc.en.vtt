00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.945
So instead of exposing these guys to the Internet,

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:06.480
that's okay we're going to leave them public but we're not

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.180
going to share their address with anybody.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.370
What we're going to do is I'm going to set up an Amazon service in front of them,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.620
that's going to provide access to both of

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.850
them nearly at the same time or in an equal way,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.600
and we're going to call that a load balancer.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.630
So, we're going to look for the icon here for load balancer.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.235
If I can find it.

00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.560
Now beyond your Compute down here.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.160
The job of the load balancer is exactly what it sounds like you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.285
will provide workers in this case it's going to be two web servers,

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:49.835
and these two web servers are going to be behind this load balancer.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.780
The load balancer you're going to give it a name and that's going to be

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.215
your business.com or whatever address you're using,

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:59.975
and that's going to be your one of entry into your service.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.360
What the application load balancer is going to do,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.915
is going to send requests to your servers,

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.140
and it's going to equally distribute the load of incoming requests.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.680
So if you get a 100 users at the same time,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.485
a 1,000 users at the same time,

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:17.970
is going to distribute the load equally to both servers.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.000
Now, keep in mind,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.055
I don't have an auto scaling group here.

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:24.185
This is something that you need to understand.

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:30.925
If I think that these two web servers are not enough to handle the traffic that I have,

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.199
on my normal day-to-day operations,

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:38.750
I should be using an auto scaling group to make them be able to expand and contract,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.240
to spin up more servers as needed behind the load balancer,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.530
and the load balancer can be associated not only with servers specifically,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.705
but also with an auto scaling group.

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:53.240
Which means if you have 10 new servers that just

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.580
were spin up automatically about an auto scaling group,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.350
the load balancer will know this,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.020
and it will send traffic to those as needed.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.295
Also, another benefit that you get from the load balancer is, health checks.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:07.215
The load balancer will check your servers,

00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:09.195
make sure that they're operational,

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:12.125
if they're not they will be taken out of service completely

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:16.510
and traffic will be routed to the healthy instances.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.070
Now, if you have that question which you probably do,

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.045
any servers you deploy in the public sub-nets,

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:28.685
they do have visibility into the private sub-nets because we're all in the same Cloud,

00:02:28.685 --> 00:02:31.190
in the same VPC container.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.200
So in this container,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.515
it's inbound and outbound traffic is

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:41.020
unrestricted for everything within there because obviously it is trusted traffic,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.260
it is as your own traffic.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.850
So anything in there will be able to talk to one another without any issues.
