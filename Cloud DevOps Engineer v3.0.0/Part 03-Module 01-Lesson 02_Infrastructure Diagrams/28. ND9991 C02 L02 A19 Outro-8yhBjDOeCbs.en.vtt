00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.254
All right. In this lesson, we just covered how to do

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:06.629
a diagram which helps you understand how everything works.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.150
Now, with this information,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.800
what we're going to do is obviously we're going to have

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.380
a more polished diagram which we're going to

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
use in the next lesson to actually turn it into infrastructure as code.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.685
We're going to go into each component individually just like we did here,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.524
but this time it's going to be from the code perspective.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.070
We're going to go to CloudFormation.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.710
We're going to use our Visual Studio code editor to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.800
create each and every one of the resources one by one,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.230
so we can have the same explanations cover into more detail.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:41.939
I want to cover particularly the routing section which is critical for this course.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:46.059
You will see that in more detail in the next lesson.
