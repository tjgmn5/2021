00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.480
RIGHT now, let's go ahead and add NAT Service to our infrastructure.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.740
So I'll go here into the search and I'll type NAT,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.125
and here we have VPC NAT gateway.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.899
I will add one over here,

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.769
and I will add a secondary one just for the purpose of

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.219
high availability and eliminating single points of failure.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.869
I have a secondary one right here.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.529
Now, at this point,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.395
let's take a moment to understand what a NAT gateway is and does.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:41.585
A NAT or Network Address Translation Service

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:46.954
is used to provide outbound Internet access to resources in your private sub-nets.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:53.214
What it does is it translates incoming public traffic into private traffic.

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:57.170
By the way, remember, that it needs to have public access itself.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.414
So remember to place it in a public sub-net.

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:02.399
Back here in our diagram,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.554
let's say we had a server right now in our private sub-net that needed

00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:09.380
something from udacity.com or github.com.

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.379
What it could do is it could place a request to the NAT gateway,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:18.084
which will translate that private network requests into a public request,

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:20.875
which will go out through the Internet gateway,

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:25.010
and the data will come back and the NAT gateway will translate that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.285
back into private traffic that our server can see.

00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:32.989
Remember, our private sub-nets will have resources that

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.929
only half private IPs meaning that they

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.380
cannot by themselves be exposed out to the Internet,

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:41.879
so they are going to need the NAT or

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.560
Network Address Translation Service in order to be able to access

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.530
outside resources such as GitHub or

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.299
udacity.com or anything that is public relative to this network.
