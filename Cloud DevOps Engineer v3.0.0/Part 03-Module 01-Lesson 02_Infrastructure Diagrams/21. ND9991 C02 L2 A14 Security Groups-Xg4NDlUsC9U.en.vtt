00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
The very last component that we have to mention here is very,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.740
very important, it's called the "security group," and that's a way to manage traffic.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.080
So, let's try to see what it looks like to have a security group in here.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.850
The security group, it goes at the level of the server or services.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.355
So you can put it the load balancer level,

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.290
you could put it at specific instances.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.800
Actually, I am missing one component which we're going to add here in

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.360
a moment after we mention security groups. Let's see.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.125
So imagine this security group that is surrounding this server that we have.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.705
The job of the security group is to provide

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.680
network traffic control at the level of the server,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.265
not at the sub-net level,

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:54.870
not at the VPC level,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.625
not at the level of the account,

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.980
but the specific server level.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.065
So what that means is,

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:07.340
if I'm providing a web server and this web server only needs to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.260
be opened on port 80 because that's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.910
the HTTP port or traffic is going to be coming in inbound,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.645
then you open inbound, port 80,

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:18.500
using a security group and you use

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.830
that same security group to deny traffic everywhere else.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.990
And by the way, that's the default behavior.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.330
If you don't specify any open ports,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.625
the default behavior will lock down any other ports on that particular security group.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.740
Once you create that security group,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.540
you get to assign it to any resource that you want.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.055
You can assign it to a load balancer.

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:41.720
You can assign it to a web server or any other machine that you have.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.270
You can use that same security group over and over.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.010
Just remember that it applies only to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.810
a specific resources and not the overall infrastructure that you just created.
