00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.849
Now, the component that I forgot to mention earlier since we're

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:13.570
here talking about the network in part is the routing table.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.810
Let's see if we can find that.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.980
Route table I believe is proper,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.289
there it is, route table.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:33.054
So the route table is what we're going to use to specify the routing traffic rules.

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:38.679
What that means is, we want to make the private subnets be able to reach the Internet.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:39.950
So how did we do that?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.590
We associate those two private subnets to a routing table,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.105
and what we're going to specify as a simple routing rule in there.

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:53.384
Actually two. The number one is the default,

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:56.030
that's inside the BPC and we just mentioned that a moment ago,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.505
which is all inbound and outbound traffic is allowed unrestricted,

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:04.879
provided it is within the isolated BPC Cloud.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.959
So there's no problem there.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.254
This is fully open,

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:08.409
those are your servers,

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.614
so the traffic is really trusted in there.

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:13.500
Now, if we're going to the Internet,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.150
we're going to allow outbound traffic only for the private subnets,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.850
so we're going to route Internet traffic

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:23.089
from the private subnets from any server in there,

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.189
going through the NATS.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.989
It's going to look, it's going to make

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:30.024
more sense to you once we explain this in the code,

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:34.460
but for now just visualize that we have a rule that says,

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.839
if you're going to reach any address that is not within this BPC,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.590
you should go from the private traffic to the public subnet which

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.725
has NAT service and control that traffic flow from there.

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:52.369
Now this doesn't apply to the public subnet.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.025
The public subnet have another routing rule

00:01:55.025 --> 00:01:57.570
and that rule is going to be any traffic that you want,

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.894
you can send that directly to the Internet Gateway.

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:01.289
We don't have any restrictions,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.060
whether is inbound or outbound.
