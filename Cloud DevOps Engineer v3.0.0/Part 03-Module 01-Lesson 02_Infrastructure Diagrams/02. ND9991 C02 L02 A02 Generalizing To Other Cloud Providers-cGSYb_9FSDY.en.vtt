00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
Even though in this diagram you're going to see that we're using

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.710
mostly AWS as specific icons,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.099
you can be reassured that this components have

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.894
similar names when it comes to other Cloud providers.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.984
For example, you have compute resources,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:20.954
you have BMs, you have load balancers.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:23.684
These resources have the exact same names

00:00:23.684 --> 00:00:26.759
when you take them to Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.860
In fact, this is the exact same thing.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.734
In Google Cloud, they call it BPC.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.429
As well as Amazon, they call it BPC.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.649
It's just virtual private Cloud.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.225
It's not really a marketing name.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:39.289
It's the actual name of the tool that you can use.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.979
So this knowledge can certainly apply if

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.409
you end up using a different Cloud provider other than Amazon.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.989
Another thing that you should know is that there are

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.219
reference architectures that you can google,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.149
and this reference architecture will show you

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.420
a diagram similar to what we are looking at today,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.554
and that can help you also breach the gap of the name of

00:01:02.554 --> 00:01:06.560
a specific service when it comes to another Cloud.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.085
For example, you can have let's say a WordPress deployment.

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:15.619
You can look at that and AWS and then look for the similar deployment in Microsoft Azure,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.500
and that way, they're probably going to be very similar.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.325
So you can use that in order to be able to

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:28.109
compare names and learn the proper name in the Cloud provider that you'll be using.
