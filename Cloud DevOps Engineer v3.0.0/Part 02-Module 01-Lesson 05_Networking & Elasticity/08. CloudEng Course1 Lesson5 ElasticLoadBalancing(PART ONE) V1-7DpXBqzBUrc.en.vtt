00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.434
Elastic Load Balancer is a service that balances load between two or more servers,

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:08.699
stands in front of a web server,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.699
and provides redundancy and performance.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.689
Redundancy simply means that if you lose a server,

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.530
the load balancer will send requests to other working servers.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.200
Good performance simply means that if a server starts having issues or bottlenecks,

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.699
the load balancer will add more servers to the pool of available servers.
