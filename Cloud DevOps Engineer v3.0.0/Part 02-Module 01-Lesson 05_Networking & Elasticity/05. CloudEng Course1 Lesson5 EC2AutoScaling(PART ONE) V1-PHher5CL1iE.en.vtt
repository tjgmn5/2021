00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
EC2 auto-scaling is a service that monitors

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.384
your EC2 instances and automatically adjust by adding or removing

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:13.230
EC2 instances based on conditions you define in order to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.734
maintain application availability and to provide peak performance to your users.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:21.329
EC2 auto-scaling works with

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.859
AWS messaging services like the simple notification service or

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.644
SNS to alert you when EC2 auto-scaling is launching or terminating your EC2 instances.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:37.760
You can configure the alert message to contain information about the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:42.829
terminated or launched instance and the reason for termination or launch.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.364
There's also an AWS auto-scaling service that is different than the EC2

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.795
auto-scaling that allows you to set up

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:56.520
other services such as Dynamo DB to automatically scale.
