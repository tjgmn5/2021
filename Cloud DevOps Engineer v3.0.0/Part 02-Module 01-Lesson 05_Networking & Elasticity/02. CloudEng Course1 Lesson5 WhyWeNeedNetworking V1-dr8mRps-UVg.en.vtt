00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
Networks reliably carry loads of data around the globe

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:08.594
allowing for the delivery of content and applications with high availability.

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.850
The network is the foundation of your infrastructure.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.419
Without it, you wouldn't be able to do your day-to-day job,

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.445
things like check your email,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.730
or even access services on your smartphone.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.990
Cloud networking includes network architecture,

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.579
network connectivity, application delivery,

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.419
global performance and delivery.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.785
Let's look more closely at network connectivity.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:36.528
Network connectivity includes services

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:43.565
that offer reliable and cost-effective ways to route end-users to Internet applications.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.384
Let's explore a real-world example.

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:49.670
Every computer on the internet has an address,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.090
called an IP address or Internet protocol address,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.550
which is a long string of numbers.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.964
It's hard for a person to easily remember the long string of numbers to access a website.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:04.730
For example, this is Google's IP address.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.600
If I wanted to conduct a Google search,

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.099
although it would work,

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:13.089
I'm not going to enter Google's IP address in my web browser,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.564
Instead, I will enter the user friendly name, which is www.google.com.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:24.109
When I enter www.google.com behind the scenes,

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:25.474
there is a DNS,

00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:28.715
or Domain Name System resolver that ask

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:33.784
a domain authority for the IP address that maps to google.com.

00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:37.159
If you're not familiar with the term domain authority,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.405
it is the service,

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:41.915
the domain name google.com was registered with.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.630
You are then routed to that address,

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.844
and the Google website displays in your web browser.

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:54.420
DNS is one of the foundational networking services that makes the Internet work.
