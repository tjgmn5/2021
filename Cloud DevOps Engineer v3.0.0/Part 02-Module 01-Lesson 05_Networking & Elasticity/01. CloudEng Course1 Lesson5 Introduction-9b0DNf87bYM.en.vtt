00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
Now, that you know how to protect your data and systems,

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.644
you will need a way for users to find your website.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:09.660
That's where networking connectivity comes into play,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.419
to route Internet traffic to your site.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.754
You'll also want to make sure that your website can handle the incoming traffic,

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:19.515
providing peak performance to your users.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.490
The ability to scale up or scale down based on the load,

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.289
or how many users are using your applications at a given time is critical.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.390
In this lesson, I will teach you about networking and elasticity in the cloud,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.005
covering features like auto scaling and load balancing.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.400
So let's get started.
