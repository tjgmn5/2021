00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
In this lesson, I introduced you to networking in the cloud.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.570
You learned about Route 53,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.230
a service that does more than just register your domain name.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.339
It also routes to Internet traffic to the resources for your domain,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.234
and even checks the health of your resources.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:20.519
Next, we discussed elasticity in the cloud,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.274
which allows you to stop guessing about capacity needed to run your applications.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:27.359
Lastly, we discussed using

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.739
a load balancer to balance the load between two or more servers.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.280
Next, I will teach you about messaging and containers.
