00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.075
The Cloud is the perfect place to host your travel blogging website, mytrips.com.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.925
The first thing you'll need though is a server,

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.620
a powerful computer that can serve up your website when a user requests it.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.939
Next, you'll want to use security mechanisms to protect your website and data.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.160
Lastly, you'll want to use Cloud services to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.690
help you manage and maintain the lifecycle of your website.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.020
In this lesson, I will teach you about provisioning servers in the Cloud,

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.234
and common security mechanisms to keep your data safe.

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:36.350
Next, I will show you compute power in the Cloud,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.410
and orchestration services that help you manage

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:43.250
the deployment and monitoring of your cloud-based applications.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.750
So let's get started.
