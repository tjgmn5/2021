00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.310
We've discussed the need for servers in the Cloud.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.199
In your EC2 lab,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.105
you stood up your own server.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.080
AWS provides services that make the process of standing up

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.969
servers and deploying your applications to them even easier.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:22.000
Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.240
that allows you to deploy a web application at the touch of a button,

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.969
by spinning up or provisioning all of the services that you need to run your application.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.049
This service is essential because it automates the process of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:41.074
getting applications setup on the Amazon web services infrastructure.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.390
At the click of a button,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.103
Elastic Beanstalk can create an EC2 instance,

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:51.769
setup auto-scaling, and an elastic load balancer for you.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.820
You still retain control of the services automatically spun up,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.899
and you can administer them separately if you so choose.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.819
Elastic Beanstalk supports Java, PHP,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.394
Python,.NET, Node.js, Ruby, and Docker,

00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:13.194
and several common cert rephrase,

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.729
and several common servers like Apache, HTTP,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.380
Tomcat, Engine X, IIS, etc.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:26.824
Elastic Beanstalk can even spin up database instances for you,

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:32.730
VPCs and security groups all while deploying your code.
