AWS Lambda provide you compute power in the Cloud,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.115
by letting you execute code without standing up or managing servers.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:15.269
Just think of Lambda as a chunk of code that runs in the Cloud,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.745
and it's meant to do one specific task.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:21.089
Lambda should really focus on one specific task,

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:24.388
because there's currently a time limit of 15 minutes,

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:27.855
which was recently increased from five minutes.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:32.100
An application developed using Lambdas is considered to be

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.660
serverless because you're not concerned with the server your code is running on.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.349
Lambda offers several benefits.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.335
You only pay for the compute time you consume.

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:45.350
You are not charged when your code isn't running.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.489
You can author code locally,

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:52.269
and upload it, or you can write code directly via the Lambda Console.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.565
Lambda is event driven,

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:58.129
so you can run your code based on certain events happening,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.824
like a file upload,

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:02.689
or a record being inserted in a database.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.730
Once the code is uploaded,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.635
the environment takes care of everything needed to run and scale your code.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:14.945
Lambda supports several run-time environments: Node.js ,

00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:21.164
Python, Ruby, Java, Go, and.NET.

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:23.865
If you need a language that's not supported,

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:25.944
you can use custom run-times.

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:29.459
So the environment is very flexible.
