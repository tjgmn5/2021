00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.075
Days of maintaining Internal Data Centers are gone.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:12.304
No longer do you have to invest a lot of money and labor upfront to buy server hardware,

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.148
to rack and stack servers,

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.294
and to maintain data centers.

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:19.650
The Cloud provides a new opportunity for deploying

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.104
your applications and making them accessible to the world.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:29.039
Cloud services, more specifically servers in the Cloud,

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.009
have revolutionized the IT industry,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.715
and the way we do business and allocate resources,

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:38.525
allowing companies of all sizes and

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:43.070
even individual developers to obtain new servers in minutes,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.520
allowing us to quickly scale capacity up and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.810
down based on the individual needs of our applications.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.820
Servers in the Cloud allow you to build failure

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.880
resilient applications that are isolated from

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.790
common failure scenarios with capacity that can grow and shrink based on needs,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.520
and you only pay for what you use,

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:11.489
and you aren't locked into long-term contracts.
