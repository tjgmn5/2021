00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.619
The ability to run application code in the cloud without having to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.254
provision or manage servers is a software developer's dream come true.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:16.469
Placing your code in an environment that automatically scales,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.829
offers high availability and fault tolerance,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.934
frees you up to focus on what's most important,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:27.929
adding new features to or fixing issues with your existing systems.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.060
Compute power in the cloud is a faster way to build applications.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.864
Compute power in the cloud provides no servers to manage,

00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:40.974
the ability to continuously scale,

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:45.245
the ability to run code on demand in response to events,

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.169
and you only pay when your code runs.
