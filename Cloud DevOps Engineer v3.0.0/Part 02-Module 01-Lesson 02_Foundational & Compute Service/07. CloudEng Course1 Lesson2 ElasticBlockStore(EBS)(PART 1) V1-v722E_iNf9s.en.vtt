00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.400
EBS is a storage solution for EC2 instances.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.515
It is a physical hard drive that is connected to the server to increase storage.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:19.094
It has to be attached to your server and mounted before you start storing data on it.

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:24.789
Some instance types come with EBS volumes already attached.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.208
There are two types of memory for an EC2 instance;

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:34.674
in memory or instance store and on EBS.

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:39.589
The benefit of using EBS over the instance store is that you're able

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.600
to persist data after the EC2 instance is terminated or shut down.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.185
Any data stored on the volume are still accessible.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.545
A neat feature provided by AWS is that

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:57.605
each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its availability zone.

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.244
This protects you from component failure,

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:04.379
offering high availability and durability.
