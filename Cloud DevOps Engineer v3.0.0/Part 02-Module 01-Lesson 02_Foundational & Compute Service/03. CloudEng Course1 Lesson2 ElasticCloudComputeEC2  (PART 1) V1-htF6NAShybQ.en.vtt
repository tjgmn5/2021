00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.770
Elastic cloud compute or EC2 is a foundational piece of

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.619
AWS's cloud computing platform and

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.829
is a service that provides servers for rent in the cloud.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.405
Users are able to manage the servers and deploy applications to it.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:21.179
These servers are called instances.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.335
So you will hear developers refer to an EC2 instance.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:29.955
Instances are actual physical servers in an AZ or data center.

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:33.945
So EC2 is not considered serverless.

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:39.689
A nice feature of EC2 is that it is elastic like the name

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:45.354
says and can grow or shrink based on the needs or load on the application.

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:48.619
Essentially, additional servers can be automatically

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:52.864
provisioned or servers that aren't needed anymore can be removed.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:57.905
You have re-sizable compute capacity in the Cloud which is pretty amazing.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:02.929
You even have the ability to manage the server and install applications on it.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.849
So let's log into the AWS console to review an EC2 instance.
