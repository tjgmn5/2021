Let's talk about how AWS implement security for servers.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.630
Typically, when you create resources,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.714
they are on a flat network that is shared among various AWS users,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.800
such as EC2 classic.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.039
A flat network is a simple network design that reduces cost and overall administration.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.089
All devices and workstations are connected to a single switch.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.100
Meaning all devices are a part of

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.520
the same broadcast network and communicate with each other.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:39.019
Virtual private cloud or VPC allows you to create

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.115
your own private space or private network in the cloud.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:47.975
Then you launch your services like EC2 inside of that private network,

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:50.570
and EC2 inherits security.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.119
This is done as a security measure.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.934
We control the network configuration and security and expose what we do

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:03.054
or do not want exposed to the Internet using public or private subnets.

00:01:03.054 --> 00:01:09.420
VPC lives within a region and can span across multiple ECs.
