00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.700
Stories about companies being hacked,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.505
and customer data being stolen are rampant.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:11.040
Now that you have servers running in the Cloud

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.559
as opposed to your own internal data server,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.560
it is important you take the necessary steps to keep

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:20.789
your data and customer information safe and secure.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.609
Security in the Cloud allows you to have

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.015
complete control over your virtual networking environment.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:32.534
Once you've configured your virtual network with public or private basing sub nets,

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:38.949
you can then launch a place your servers in the selected network to secure access.
