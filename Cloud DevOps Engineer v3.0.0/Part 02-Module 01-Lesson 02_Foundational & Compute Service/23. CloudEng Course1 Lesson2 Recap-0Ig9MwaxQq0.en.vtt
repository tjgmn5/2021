00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.884
In this lesson, I introduced you to a foundational piece of

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:08.294
AWS's Cloud computing platform, EC2 Instances.

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:12.285
You learned that an Instance is a server that you rent in the Cloud.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:15.240
We also discussed how Elastic Block Store

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.644
allows you to expand the capacity of your instance.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:22.980
I then showed you how to use VPC to secure your instances.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.539
We wrapped up by discussing how lambdas give you compute power in the Cloud,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.199
and how orchestration services like Elastic Beanstalk help you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.619
manage the lifecycle of your applications and the services behind them.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:41.189
Next, I will teach you about storage and content delivery in the Cloud.
