Hello. My name is Noah Gift and I'm the founder of

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.850
Pragmatic AI Labs and I wrote the book Pragmatic AI,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.430
an Introduction to cloud-based machine learning,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.490
as well as the book Python for DevOps by O'Reilly.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.320
I lecture at Northwestern,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.375
UC Berkeley and UC Davis.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.590
Today, I'm going to discuss operationalizing micro services.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.255
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:26.355
So one of the first things that we want to pay attention to when we're operationalizing

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:32.505
a micro service is how to respond to alerts and how to actually respond to an incident.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.760
One of the things that you can do is you can use Prometheus.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.190
Prometheus is a monitoring system that we talked about in a previous lesson

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.365
and it's actually really closely coupled with the way Kubernetes works.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:48.320
Another one is you can actually design your own custom alerts.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.120
So you could use Python,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.690
you can write some custom alerts that respond to certain events.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.520
Maybe they look at HTTP status codes or they look at the latency of something.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.420
Another one is you can use an off-the-shelf driver like Stackdriver.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.460
So the Google Cloud has the ability to introspect things that are on

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.580
its platform by using the Stackdriver monitor or

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.300
you could also run it on the AWS platform as well.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.550
Finally, there's companies like Weaveworks.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.220
Weaveworks has many tools that allow you to

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.060
do monitoring around different container workflows.
