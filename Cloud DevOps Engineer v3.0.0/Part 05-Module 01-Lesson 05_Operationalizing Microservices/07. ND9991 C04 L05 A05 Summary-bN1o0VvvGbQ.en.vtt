00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
All right. So in this lesson,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.285
we covered quite a bit about operationalizing microservices,

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:09.074
we covered alerts and incident responses,

00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:10.754
we covered disaster recovery,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.470
we covered continuous integration pipelines,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.844
we covered getopts, and then finally we talked about load testing.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:21.929
These are all critical pieces for operationalizing your microservice,

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.899
and private being the final takeaway is that.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.699
Again, with disaster recovery,

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.544
it's one of those things that is really something you should take very seriously.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:35.359
It doesn't mean you need to dedicate all your time to disaster recovery,

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.229
but having seen this happen many times as an engineering manager.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.869
If you don't plan for the worst-case scenario,

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:45.829
the worst-case scenario will be a situation that will potentially

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.920
completely devastate your department or your organization.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.745
So when you plan ahead,

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:54.274
you can expect those bad things to happen.

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:59.640
Then as a result, you'll be able to gracefully handle any failure that comes your way.
