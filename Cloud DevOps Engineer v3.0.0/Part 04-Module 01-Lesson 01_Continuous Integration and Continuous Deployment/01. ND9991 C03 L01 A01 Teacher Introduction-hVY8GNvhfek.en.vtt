00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
Hello and welcome to course three Lesson One of the DevOps nano degree.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.900
My name is Owen Reid and I currently work as a senior DevOps engineer for

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.265
Figure Eight which is a data annotation company in the AI space.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.770
I've worked in the DevOps industry for about

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.460
the last 13 years and originally I started out as a Linux SysAdmin and then that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.105
evolved into a systems engineering job title and

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:33.090
now we call it either DevOps or SRE, Site Reliability Engineer.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.960
Site reliability engineer's more focused on monitoring and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.225
analytics DevOps is more the setup and creation of infrastructure.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.955
So I originally came into working in

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:52.100
DevOps from one of my very first college courses which was

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.650
a course in C++ and it was taught by

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.780
a professor who worked for a local startup company and they were teaching the course

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.290
at night and so this course has really bring things 360 for

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.790
myself because I'm able to come back and share

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.705
with you some of the knowledge that I've acquired over these past 13 years

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:17.400
and I hope to be able to help you in your career and your involvement of your skills.
