00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
So, this is something that it's got

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.114
its roots in technology that comes out of the early 90s,

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:10.035
which is Continuous Integration.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:16.740
However, the tools to really be able to effectively do this really came about with

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:24.644
the rise of Jenkins and other platforms to perform these actions.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.300
We are going to be covering

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.989
the core components of this and the techniques of how to do it,

00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:42.359
and some of the best practices of how we do CI and CD in the DevOps space.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:49.524
So first up, let's talk a little bit about what came before CI and CD.

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:53.679
Before we had tools to automate this process,

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.905
a lot of this was just done of deploying binaries to servers or to desktops.

00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:04.060
This came with a lot of brittleness of,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.275
if you deploy it,

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.900
it would take a lot of work to put it there,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.650
and then to deploy a new release would take substantially more work.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.045
So you get into this cycle where

00:01:16.045 --> 00:01:21.519
it's compounding your complexity with creating new environments,

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:23.890
with managing these environments,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.385
and with giving huge variety of people access to these platforms and these technologies.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:38.420
So that's really where we have the need for a tool like Jenkins to manage these.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.939
With Jenkins, we have a huge number of plugins that

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.625
allow us to store our configurations as code,

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.784
a law in GitHub,

00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:55.099
and to create pipelines,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.239
which we're going to do with a Blue Ocean.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:00.500
There are other tools that we will not be covering,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.844
but they do similar stuff with pipelines.

00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:05.019
Not to mention, you don't need Blue Ocean,

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:09.189
you can do pipelines just with the core Jenkins platform as well.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.474
So next up, we're going to talk about just,

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:17.375
what is the definition of CI and CD?

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:21.080
Continuous Integration is a development practice,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.713
where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently,

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.759
preferably seven times a day.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:32.944
Each integration can then be verified by automated build and automated test.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.750
Then for Continuous Deployment is a strategy

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.539
for software releases wherein any code commit that

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.879
passes the automated testing phase is

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.150
automatically released into the production environment,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.064
making changes that are visible to the software users.

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:52.164
So this is from Search Operations Tech Target.

00:02:52.164 --> 00:02:58.919
So let's just take the 10000 foot overview on what that means.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:05.004
So this slide is to give you a diagram of first starting with the user,

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:07.750
which is you managing your code.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.979
You check in a change into

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:14.269
a Git Repository for a new feature that you've added to your product.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.605
Then this pull request is reviewed by two of your colleagues,

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:24.560
and this then gets merged back into your Repository,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.469
and Jenkins is able to start the pipeline.

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:29.705
So we have our little pipeline icon.

00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:33.500
Next up comes our cute Linton process,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.340
which Linton is when we're checking for any kind of

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.439
problem in the code you've made like a type of some sort.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.050
After we've successfully Linton it,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.405
we want a security check it,

00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:51.890
and finally we want to actually deploy it,

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.914
being the final step here.

00:03:53.914 --> 00:03:58.560
This is mainly for our development and our staging environments.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.250
Our production environments usually don't have

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.514
continuous deploy because that's considered too dangerous.

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:11.554
So this is what we're dealing with as

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:16.495
the technologies that are involved with Jenkins and CI/CD.

00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:24.810
So next up, we're going to start getting deep into pipelines.
