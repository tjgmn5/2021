00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.220
Let's take a short stop here because this is an area of common concern, which is,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.260
well, I need to take a break from whatever work I'm doing in AWS,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.824
and I don't want to be running up a high bill.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:23.289
So the way we do this is we stop and image our instance.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.474
Under the Action menu,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.790
we have Instance State, Stop.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.450
Now, it's preferable to be logged

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.304
in to your instance and do a shutdown but this will work as well.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:41.789
Then we also have, Image, Create image.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.094
So you can, if you have it imaged,

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:49.719
you'll be able to completely delete it.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.710
Both of these states, either be in a sub-state or having an image of it,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.630
and having an instance not in existence will be of the same cost.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.935
I'm just expanding the options that you have available to you.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:08.670
So this is just another way to save money in AWS.
