00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.075
Great. We have our new AWS EC2 instance,

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:11.219
and we're going to presume that you have set up SSH keys for that instance,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.330
and we're going to go ahead and log into that instance.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.234
So let's pull up console session,

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:26.379
and we're going to log in as the Ubuntu user because this is an Ubuntu instance.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.390
First things first, we want to make sure that we're using

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.359
the latest and the greatest software,

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.935
so we're going to do an apt update.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:45.050
This just makes sure that we pull from the repositories of what the newest versions are,

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:52.649
and it puts those into our metadata on our system to be able to know what's out there.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.335
Now that we've done that,

00:00:55.335 --> 00:01:00.704
we can go about actually installing.

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:03.768
We're going to start with the dependency requirement,

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:07.804
which is, Jenkins is a Java application.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:12.995
Let's go ahead and apt install -y,

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:18.635
which the -y just means yes and so it's not going to prompt us, default-jdk.

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:22.975
JDK is Java Development Kit,

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:26.674
and that's already installed so it doesn't take any time at all.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:28.640
Now that we've got that,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.320
we can install Jenkins.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.944
Once again, it's already installed so we've completed that step.

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:41.299
Wonderful. Now we can move on to actually

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.689
logging into Jenkins and seeing how it works in the GUI.
