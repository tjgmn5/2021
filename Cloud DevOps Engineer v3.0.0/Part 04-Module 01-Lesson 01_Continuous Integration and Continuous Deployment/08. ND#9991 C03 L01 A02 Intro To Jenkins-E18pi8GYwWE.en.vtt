00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
So now we're going to talk about one

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.219
of the core technologies that we're using in this course,

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:06.809
which is the Jenkins.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:12.539
Jenkins is the Swiss army knife of build tools,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.230
and it gives you a huge amount of extendability,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.890
flexibility, with a lot of plugins and can use and support a lot of different languages.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.705
So we're first going to just take a look at the history of Jenkins,

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.794
which it is brought to us in 2011.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:37.145
It was an offshoot from some microsystems Hudson which the open-source community

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:43.609
was concerned about having a CI/CD platform which was under control of some microsystems.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.509
So that was the source of the creation of Jenkins,

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:51.409
because they wanted to have this open-source product to

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.379
do all of these magical things that we use inside this the CI/ CD space.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.353
So this is just fun these are some of the Jenkins icons,

00:01:03.353 --> 00:01:10.144
and this is relevant because for instance Jenkins configuration as code.

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:13.519
One of the most important concepts that we're

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.494
going to talk about today is Infrastructure as Code.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:22.939
Jenkins configuration as code is also very relevant to that as well.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.840
So what that means is your configurations are checked

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.870
into a source control repository such as Git.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.420
We also have some other fun icons here,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.719
but they're less relevant to the course that we're sitting today.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.870
The evolution of Jenkins,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.620
the current cutting edge is Jenkins-X,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.530
which really brings in Docker microservices and Kubernetes.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.239
This is the next generation of Jenkins,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.750
but we're not going to cover that in this specific course

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.265
because we're more concerned with pipelines.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:07.290
Next we're going to dive right in with configuring our AWS account.
