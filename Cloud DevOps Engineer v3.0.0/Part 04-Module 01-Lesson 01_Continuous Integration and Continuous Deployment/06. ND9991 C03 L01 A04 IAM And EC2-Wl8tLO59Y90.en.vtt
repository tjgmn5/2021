00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
All right. Let's dive right in,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.950
and we're going to configure with

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.140
our root account that we've set up for our new AWS account,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.020
and we're going to set up a minimum credential user to

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.340
be able to perform all the actions that we're going to do as part of course three.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.995
So first things first,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.995
let's log into AWS,

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.395
and here we are, already logged in.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.525
We're going to go into the Identity Access Management console,

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:34.170
and we're going to click on Policies,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.230
and we're going to click on Create Policy.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.070
Let's select what service is going to be able to do,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.770
and we're going to first setup for EC2.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.430
Now let's give it

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.690
the action level it's able to perform and let's set it to All Resources.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.940
We're going to also configure it to be able to talk to S3.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.679
Let's set all actions,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.870
set the resource to All Resources.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.040
Now, this is just for this specific development environment.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.375
For your production environment,

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:32.070
you will definitely want to lock down what actions

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.925
is able to perform, preference on read-only.

00:01:35.925 --> 00:01:37.755
Then in terms of resource,

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:41.695
only give it access to those resources that it absolutely has to use,

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:46.280
because you want to adopt a minimum security model.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.205
So we're going to click on Review Policy.

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.020
I've already created a policy,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.360
but you will click on Create Policy.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.860
So I'm going to click Cancel here.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.335
Next, we're going to look into groups.

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:04.655
So let's click on Groups on the left-hand side here,

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:08.070
and click on Create Group,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.260
type the group name.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.690
We have this very convenient filter here,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.150
where we can set just a Customer Managed,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.100
we'll select a policy.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.665
Click Next, you're going to click Create Group.

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:32.520
I will click Cancel because I've already created this group.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.240
Next, we're going to go to users,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.039
click Add user, type username,

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:50.370
and we're going to want both programmatic access and console access.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.525
We're going to select our group.

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:57.640
Click Next step.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.955
Let's give it a tag.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:06.890
It's highly advisable to use a lot of tags based on important metadata

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.635
for whatever specific user or resource you're talking about.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:19.140
So we're just going to say Department IT.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.820
So you will click Create User,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.120
I'm clicking Cancel because I already have the user.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.350
Now we have our IAM policy,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.915
fully configured and set up with our new user.

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.390
So let's login with that new user,

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.360
and then we're going to proceed to configure a new instance.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.395
So I'm already fully logged in with my new user,

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:52.220
and I'm going to go into the EC2 section and make sure that I'm in instances,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.150
and I will click Launch Instance.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.880
Let's filter it down,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.845
we just want the Ubuntu 1804,

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:05.855
and make sure that you're in 64-bit X86,

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:11.185
because that's the only one which will give you the free-tier.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:17.230
We're going to select AT2 micro Instance,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.995
and we're going to configure it except the defaults here,

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.575
and we're going to skip storage.

00:04:24.575 --> 00:04:27.840
We'll add just one tag.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.420
Set the name to Jenkins.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.910
Now this is one of the most important steps,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.505
we want to make sure that our service is set to My IP,

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:50.060
and this is because we want to only give yourself access from your local IP address.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.780
People scan the Internet 24-hours a day for new instances that are coming online on AWS,

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.270
and a bunch of other networks,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.070
and then attempt to compromise those hosts.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.345
So you don't want to be one of those people that has their host compromised.

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.925
But also be aware that, if your network changes,

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.490
if you go to a library or a cafe,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.850
and you suddenly have a new IP address,

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.150
new public-facing IP address,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.680
you'll need to update this from the AWS console as well.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.485
We're also going to add access to a custom TCP.

00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:31.970
This is the port of the Jenkins Console which uses Java,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.610
and their default name convention is 8080 for a port 80 style application.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.445
We're going to set that to My IP,

00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:45.570
and we're going to click Review and Launch.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.330
You're going to click Launch I'm

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.040
going to a click Cancel because they already have this running,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.010
and we can go about moving on to

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.750
our next step of installing Jenkins onto that EC2 instance.
