Good job. Okay. So at this point,

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.429
we've covered how to add an Apt repo,

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:10.710
which is to give us access to the Jenkins software onto our Ubuntu instance.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.054
We've also covered how to add additional users and groups

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:23.820
via L-Dapper Active Directory incorporated into your Jenkins management interface.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.810
There is now Blueocean present in the environment that we

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.619
can leverage to create our pipelines. Moving up.
