00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.724
My name is Alan Reid and I've been working in the DevOps space for about 12 years now.

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:13.230
Some of the larger companies that I've worked for that you're more likely to be aware of,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.609
Turnitin, which does plagiarism detection on student papers.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.879
NETGEAR, you probably know somebody

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.329
who has a NETGEAR switch or router or WiFi access point.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.924
I've also worked for HeartFlow,

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.039
which is a smaller company but

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.339
interesting because they're in the biomedical imaging space.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.410
They're able to take imagery of the heart and then parse that and create

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.500
a colorized model to show obstructions in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.600
the blood vessels that can be a predictor for cardiovascular heart disease,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.625
which is pretty interesting.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.159
Right now, I work for Figure Eight,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.789
which is in the artificial intelligence space.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.609
In the time that I've been working in the industry,

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.390
I've really been able to experience the transition from

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.290
managing racks of servers to managing servers

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.485
inside of environments such as AWS or Azure or what have you, Cloud environments.

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:21.105
It's really been a radical transformation and it's been a fun run.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:24.870
So my work as I mentioned,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.359
I started out doing more on a combination of the systems side,

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.295
but there's always monitoring.

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:36.469
I mean regardless of what you're doing,

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.250
monitoring is always a core aspect and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.540
requirement to be able to know the status of something.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.215
In those days, a lot of the monitoring was done with Najos,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:52.954
which is considerably old and outdated at this point in my opinion.

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:56.209
But nowadays, we've transformed

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.549
using more advanced and progressive software like Prometheus.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.849
I mean I've definitely also had to leverage doing

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:15.269
builds with combination of software.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.409
But predominantly, a lot of the places

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.979
that I've worked have had Jenkins in some capacity.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.060
It's just like the multi-use tool

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.750
of choice for most companies to be able to manage their bills.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.235
It's because of its flexibility and open-ended aspect that

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:39.275
makes it such a requirement to be able to

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:45.349
manage your builds effectively and to collaborate and to reduce

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.469
the conflict between people working on developing the same piece of software.

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:58.129
Because one of the biggest time sucks for any large project is how do you collaborate,

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.370
how do you resolve problems quickly,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.810
and when you have a shared build system and like multiple people,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.430
not just a single person,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.260
take responsibility for managing,

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:13.090
configuring, setting up, and monitoring this build system,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.719
it makes the whole software life cycle work better.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.585
Then just to touch base real briefly on configuration management,

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:29.030
the industries also had real transformation with configuration management.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.460
When I first encountered configuration management,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.210
I was with CFEngine,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.719
which is one of the granddaddy of configuration management.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.919
But now things have transformed industry wide towards

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:49.259
technologies that make your configuration management more intuitive in ansible.

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.689
In my mind, really one of those at the front of the pack,

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:00.259
because it's taken the knowledge that we've learned from using these lower level,

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.859
more difficult to use configuration management technologies like

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.255
CFEngine and just distilled that and come out with a smarter,

00:04:09.254 --> 00:04:11.759
more compact faster product.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.884
A lot of it is just about like time to market.

00:04:15.884 --> 00:04:18.524
Because with configuration management,

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:23.704
you can abstract so much of your work and be able to do

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:30.379
complex things and manage hundreds of servers with a team of less than 10 people.

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.430
That's phenomenal, that's not something you could have done 10 years ago.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.019
The skills that employers are really looking for is somebody who's

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:44.435
able to come in and be able to do scripting,

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:49.655
do monitoring, do builds, do configuration management,

00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:55.129
and these skills are really just fundamental to being able to

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.360
help automate and orchestrate virtually any startup in existence.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.210
It's really going to be pretty hard for you to find

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:08.659
a startup that doesn't use all of those technologies.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:18.450
So this course really leads into the DevOps role of a junior DevOps engineer,

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:24.125
and it also leads into a site reliability role as well.

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:29.029
There's very much complimentary skillset between these two roles.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.319
For the site reliability role,

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.409
it's more of an emphasis on monitoring and response to problems and less

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.935
on an emphasis on the creation of infrastructure in scripting and management,

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:47.165
but they both have quite a bit overlap in terms of skillsets.

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:51.050
To a lesser degree, that the industry is moving away

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.220
from job titles such as a systems engineer,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.085
which I've held at previous companies or systems administrator.

00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:02.639
But those are also job titles that would be relevant.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.579
Big skill that they look for is; a,

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:11.379
you need to know how to script and program in the language,

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.504
preferably the language they use.

00:06:13.504 --> 00:06:15.334
But if not the language they use,

00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:17.555
preferably the language that's similar.

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:20.269
The two languages that really spring to my mind is

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:24.483
been the most relevant to many hiring managers,

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:26.974
would be like Python and Ruby.

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:32.040
I feel like they're easy to use and they

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.970
make scripting and programming fast and intuitive.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.790
So for the types of things that you're managing as a DevOps engineer,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.379
you want a language which doesn't need to be like super low level,

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.269
it needs to get the job done quickly so to speak.
