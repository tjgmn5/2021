00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.445
Great. So we have installed Jenkins on the command line.

00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:08.339
Let's go ahead and login for the first time in the GUI,

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.699
which stands for graphic user interface.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.769
So we pull up our favorite web browser,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:25.484
and we're going to the public IP address and then make sure you put in :8080 and enter.

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:30.089
We're going to login.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.969
When you see this the first time,

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.564
you're going to have to enter in

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:42.359
the initial admin password in which it will prompt you for and set up a user.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.465
We login, and the first time that we login,

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:53.950
we need to configure Jenkins.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.240
So let's click on Manage Jenkins.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.605
I should mention that for a large environment,

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:09.385
you will want to be able to have

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:15.344
multiple users and it's highly advisable to use things like LDAP,

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:20.679
which Active Directory incorporates LDAP inside of it to be able to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.345
authenticate all of these users against a common user group password source.

00:01:26.344 --> 00:01:30.754
We're going to cover managing the plugins right now.

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:32.989
Let's hop on over here.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:35.989
The first tab is starch here is updates.

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:39.469
But what we actually want is available.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.409
So we click over here,

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.045
and then we're going to filter it.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:48.230
Let's filter for Blue Ocean.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.350
We of course want Blue Ocean.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.204
We also want quite a number of the pieces

00:01:55.204 --> 00:02:00.900
that give us additional tools: Git Pipeline for Blue Ocean,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.600
GitHub Pipeline for Blue Ocean.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.909
Now, once we've checked off all the components that we need,

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.490
we have at the bottom of the screen Install without restart.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.689
So we'll click on that.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.760
Now, this is pretty cool because it's now able to go out

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:41.514
to the Internet and pull down our plug-ins for us automatically,

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:44.889
which everything that is automatic is cool.

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.719
We can see it performing those actions in the background.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.620
Now, we have a checkbox down here.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.625
Restart Jenkins when installation is complete.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.039
So we'll let it go ahead and and do its thing.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:06.889
It has to completely reload the interface in order to bring up the new binaries.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.119
Great. So now we've got Blue Ocean the plugin installed,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.735
and we had to restart Jenkins in order to get those binaries to load correctly.

00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:17.415
So let's log back into Jenkins,

00:03:17.414 --> 00:03:21.370
and we can check out the Blue Ocean interface.

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.474
So you will observe on the left-hand side of the screen,

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:35.180
we have a link that's called open Blue Ocean.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.610
We're going to cover that in a subsequent lesson.
