00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.714
So now we're going to work with setting up our AWS environment,

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:10.169
which for this we're going to need to use IAM.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:14.219
Basically, what you start with is you have your root credentials,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.524
but we want to use best practices within the space.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:22.723
So we're going to create a new user that will actually

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:27.820
have access to the resources that we specifically assign them to do so.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.804
That's because you want to have a minimum permission model.

00:00:31.804 --> 00:00:35.780
So now we're going to dive into IAM with AWS,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.024
which I'm really excited to share with you guys because this is really

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:45.289
what is the foundation for security in an AWS environment.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.945
So with this tool, we're rarely able to lock it down so that we can keep out bad actors,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:56.185
and we can also adopt a minimum permission model for our user.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:58.590
All right. So first things first,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.685
we are here about to create a policy

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:05.450
and let's go ahead and come up with a good name for that policy.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.250
So we'll just say Minimum_Security_model.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.200
We've already given it full access to EC2 and full access to CloudWatch.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.534
However, we're not quite done with it just yet.

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:31.299
We're also going to add access to S3.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.968
So for this, we have to grant it not only the actions that can perform,

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:41.500
but also the resources that it can interact with.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.040
So one of the very beautiful things about what AWS gives us is

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.140
a high degree of granularity in terms of breaking things apart.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.715
So for instance, you'll see bucket, job, and object.

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:59.344
A bucket is analogous to a folder,

00:01:59.344 --> 00:02:04.265
an object would be analogous to a file in a folder.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:09.050
So we're going to go ahead and say all resources because right now we're

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.344
just concerned with giving the overhead in terms of EC2,

00:02:14.344 --> 00:02:18.379
S3, CloudWatch actions, but in

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.504
an actual production environment you'd be very concerned with locking these things down.

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:27.079
So that's something that you yourself can dive into in a deeper basis later.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.725
So we've got EC2, S3, and CloudWatch.

00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:33.829
We're going to go ahead and review that policy.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.350
So we pay very close attention here to our access level and our resources,

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.864
and that's not pertinent right now but we'll create policy,

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:45.650
and let's see how this comes out.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.110
All right. So now we've created our policy and what we can do is we can filter.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.835
This makes it a lot easier to manage your own personal policies,

00:02:55.835 --> 00:03:00.379
because you want to separate those

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.954
apart from the other policies just to be able to view them a little easier.

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:07.085
So we filter to that,

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:08.495
we have that there,

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:13.754
and then we're going to use that information,

00:03:13.754 --> 00:03:18.639
that policy, to create a role.

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.699
So we're going to set a group name here and it's just got to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.194
be something that seems applicable to you.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:38.159
We're going to say DevOpsC3.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.064
Now we're going to select our policy that we've created before,

00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:48.634
and we're going to apply that policy to our group.

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:51.215
Then we have that policy added.

00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:54.390
So now we're going to go ahead and add our user.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.879
For this user, I'm ongoing to create access for myself,

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.549
I'm going to give it programmatic access and this is very important because this is

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.510
going to give us our access key and our secret access key,

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.810
and then AWS management console access which will

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.455
enable us to log in to what we're logged into right now.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:22.865
So we're going to just let it do all of this things and hit our next step.

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:26.480
We have the capability

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.450
of adding this user to group which we created in our previous step.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.319
So we're going to do that and then we can create tags.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.769
So tags is something that we're just going to cover very briefly.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:41.524
But basically, you want to use tags to label things

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:46.399
so that you know what those things are associated with.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.949
So we're going to say,

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:58.069
Instructor, and we'll say DevOps C3.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:06.719
Then we'll say, First_name.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.674
So each of these will more be on the business model of whatever

00:05:14.673 --> 00:05:19.189
the company needs to associate with these objects.

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.699
So we'll click on "Create User",

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.329
and now I am not going to

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:30.789
let you guys look at that secret access key for obvious reasons.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.569
We can now pull up this in a new window to be able to login.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.129
So let's open that into an incognito window

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:46.894
because we're logged in with our root access privileges.

00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:50.704
So now we're going to login with our newly created user

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:55.149
and we have to use our old password that we've done with the creation of the user,

00:05:55.149 --> 00:06:02.810
and I strongly recommend that you create a new password and use a password manager.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.780
This is very important, because this will prevent you from forgetting it later,

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.504
and it'll also help you with increase in the complexity requirements.

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:14.839
So for instance, you can set it to 20 characters and mix and match

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.564
between uppercase and lowercase in letters and numbers and special characters.

00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:26.579
So now we're going to go ahead and log that in for ourselves.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.175
Okay. So now we are here fully logged in with our new user,

00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:47.639
and we're going to get into setting up our EC2 instance in the next video.
