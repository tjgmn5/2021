00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's talk about the benefits of function-as-a-service.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
Simplicity, that's one of the best benefits of function-as-a-service.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.320
You really have a function and you deploy it,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.640
and that's it, it's a great really intuitive model.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.115
Another thing is that, it's event-based,

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.794
so you don't have to have something running all the time, servers to manage.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:24.870
In fact, there's a slogan that AWS mentions called,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.655
"No server is better than a server," or loosely paraphrased.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.845
This is because things are event-based,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:34.019
so you can have all this logic

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.095
sitting in the Cloud but it doesn't run until you need it to run.

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.890
It also can be much more cost-effective.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.450
So if you think about it,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.980
when you don't use something,

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.454
like you have an automatic light timer or you have a temperature thermostat,

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:50.420
it's the same type of a concept.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.980
You don't always have to have something running.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.049
It only runs when it's necessary or it's the right conditions,

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.265
just like your thermostat.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:01.670
So, really, leveraging these cloud-native technologies,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.769
it really benefits you because you can combine all these things

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:08.420
together and actually create

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.064
a more sophisticated yet simple application that's event-based,

00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:15.989
is more cost-effective, and, ultimately, more powerful.
