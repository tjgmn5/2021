00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's talk about a model for Serverless.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.475
So what is a model for Serverless?

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.800
It's going to evolve frameworks.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.990
It's going to involve platforms.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460
It's also going to involve tools and some of the different tools and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.875
frameworks that you may have heard of is actually Serverless itself.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.670
So there's a framework that deploys Serverless models called Serverless,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.015
and it packaged together everything from

00:00:26.015 --> 00:00:31.175
node-based applications to Python based applications to Java based applications.

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:34.100
Another one that I like to use is called Chalice.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.970
Chalice is a decorator based approach where you install it.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.520
You put a decorator on top of a function,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.985
and then that function automatically gets deployed as a web service.

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:48.030
Another way that you can deploy tools is you can use

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.160
AWS's Infrastructure as a Code CloudFormation.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.330
Also terraform, which is a third party company made by HashiCorp can also build

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.480
out lambdas that could actually be triggered inside of configuration files,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.415
and those configuration files then get deployed into the Amazon ecosystem.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.655
Finally, terraform also could work with

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.640
other Cloud providers and it could deploy let's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.980
say Google Cloud Functions or Azure Cloud Functions.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.344
Now, if we look at events and actions,

00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:24.500
this is really an important concept.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.040
So let's look at what a event could actually be.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.475
It could be an example of let's say uploading the file.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:36.545
So if you take a file and you upload it and directly put it into Amazon S3,

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:41.405
that file when it's actually persisted onto the S3 ecosystem,

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.045
it's going to trigger an event.

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.040
You can have a lambda that's waiting for that event,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.985
and that event actually then has some other action associated with it.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:53.750
That event could be let's say I want

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.220
to trigger transforming this image file into a video file,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.680
or I want to take this image and I want to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.965
shrink it into a smaller size or to a different format.

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:06.725
Another event could be putting a message in a queue.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:10.330
So you have an event that comes into this queue.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.990
All of a sudden another lambdas listening,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.250
and that lambda could go through and process that message.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.520
Another fascinating way to think about events is time.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.970
So in the case of time,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.525
one of the things that can happen is you could actually create a whole ETL pipeline.

00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:30.235
ETL stands for Extract Transfer Load,

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:34.940
and this extract transfer load pipeline could be triggered on a periodic interval,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.275
let's say once a day,

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:39.500
and it could go through and talk to a relational database,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.420
pull out some information transform

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
it and then put that into your machine learning system.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.825
So in general, to really summarize here,

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:50.735
an event is something that leads to an action,

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:53.310
and that action is a piece of code.
