00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
Okay. Let's walk through some of these examples that we talked about earlier.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.170
There was the example of the garage.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.810
So let's go revisit that example.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.105
We have a garage here and inside of the garage there's that light, right?

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:20.100
We know that the light bulb itself will turn on, on certain events.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.355
So what are the triggers that could turn on this automated light?

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.900
Well, it could be a timer,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.300
so potentially we set this up through

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.310
a security system and that again goes on through eight to eight.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.590
Another one could be the garage door, right?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
So the garage door itself opens and that's a trigger.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.190
Another example that we could do is maybe a security system, right?

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.990
There's an alarm that gets triggered and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.420
automatically all the lights in the house get triggered.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.230
So these are all events that trigger a function.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.960
In this case, the function is just a light but it's the same concept with AWS.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.845
So if we go to AWS here and we go to Lambda,

00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.650
we can think of the same concepts.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.615
So in this case we have

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:09.440
a function that's sitting here doing something that's just hanging

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.230
out like the light and we have to figure out

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.320
what are the events that could go ahead and trigger that.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.060
So one of the events could be, again,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.995
a timer and in the case of AWS they call the timer CloudWatch,

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:25.540
so just initialize that as CW.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.690
There's also the API, right?

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.405
The API Gateway, that would be a web service,

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:32.360
and there's a screen cast that goes over that,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.440
that you can take a look at.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.455
Then finally, there could be maybe something like S3.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:38.960
So in S3 trigger you put a file

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.080
inside and then it goes through and it triggers that function.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.835
So much like the light that's motion controlled in your garage,

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:48.830
there's many ways to trigger it,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.990
an AWS Lambda functions is the same thing.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.330
There's many different ways to trigger it and you can set up a timer,

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.790
you can set up an API gateway,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.395
you can set up an S3 function,

00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:00.320
you can set up many other methods as well and that's

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.680
a good analogy to think about and I think that'll be helpful going forward.
