00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.059
In this lesson, I introduce to you to services like CloudWatch and CloudTrail.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.469
CloudWatch allows you to collect and track metrics that allows

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.030
you to monitor log files produced by your applications and so on.

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.894
CloudTrail allows you to audit or review everything that occurs in your AWS account.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:23.669
You learn that you can turn your infrastructure into

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.880
code using services like CloudFormation.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.594
We wrapped up by discussing the AWS CLI and saw that it was a useful tool

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:35.324
that allows you to access and control services

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:39.510
running in your AWS account from the command line.
