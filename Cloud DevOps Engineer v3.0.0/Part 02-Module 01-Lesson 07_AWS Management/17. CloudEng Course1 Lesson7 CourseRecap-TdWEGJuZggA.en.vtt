00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.245
I have enjoyed teaching the Fundamentals Of Cloud Computing.

00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:06.675
We started with an overview of the cloud.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.344
Next, we discussed servers in the cloud,

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:13.695
which led into a great discussion around storage and databases.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:16.440
After that, I taught you about security and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.325
several services you can use to protect your data and systems.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:23.535
Next, we discuss networking and elasticity,

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:26.565
touching on auto scaling and load balancing.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.600
Next, I taught you about messaging, cues, and containers,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.859
and we wrapped up with services that help you manage your cloud environment.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:36.640
While learning the fundamentals,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.140
you explore the tools and services offered by

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.859
Amazon Web Services through hands-on exercises,

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.979
and deploying your first website.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.849
You are now prepared to continue

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.660
your learning journey in the School of Cloud Computing at Udacity.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.399
If you have any questions,

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.350
