AWS Cloud Formation is AWS is infrastructure as code service.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.279
AWS Cloud formation allows you to model

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.445
your entire infrastructure in a text file template,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:16.185
allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write.

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.184
This is an example of a Cloud formation script.

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:25.320
Notice, we are able to provision EC2 instances, VPCs, and sub-nets.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.885
The templates are written using text,

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.820
either JSON or YAML.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.754
You can write one from scratch,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:35.129
or re-use a blueprint provided by AWS.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.665
Cloud formation scripts can be created using

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:40.795
a visual designer with drag and drop components.

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:43.289
Since your infrastructure is now code,

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.490
you can check your scripts into version control and even

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.760
review the files with your team in order to receive feedback.
