00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Let's see CloudWatch in action.

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:05.564
From the AWS management console,

00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:08.775
type CloudWatch and click on it.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.565
From the left-hand menu navigation,

00:00:11.564 --> 00:00:13.634
let's click on "Logs".

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:16.995
Notice I have a lot of logs.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:18.868
One thing that is neat,

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:22.425
within each log group after AWS,

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.045
it shows the service.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:25.620
So in this case,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.150
the user logs from the Connect service connect as the Cloud call center.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.070
Here, I have logs from Green Grass that allows AWS services

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.829
to run at the edge on IoT devices like the AWS deep lens.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.969
If you keep scrolling,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.280
you'll see lambda logs.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.600
Lastly, you'll see logs from Sage maker.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.609
This is the machine learning service.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.134
Let's look at the logs for one of my lambda functions.

00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:54.304
Let's pick this one.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.530
The log for my word jumble Alexis skill.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.734
Here again there are several logs.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.339
Let's just click on the first one.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.500
Let's scroll through.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.269
Notice here there is

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.000
just generic logging information about when the Alexis skill was invoked.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.965
But notice here I am actually writing this out from my lambda function,

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.645
and in this case,

00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:26.239
it shows the particular level that the user has reached in the word jumble game,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.894
in this case, 28.

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:31.399
Logging is very helpful when you're supporting

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.120
an application or even when you're in active development.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.640
CloudWatch really helps with that.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.099
So this was a quick look at CloudWatch and a few sample logs.
