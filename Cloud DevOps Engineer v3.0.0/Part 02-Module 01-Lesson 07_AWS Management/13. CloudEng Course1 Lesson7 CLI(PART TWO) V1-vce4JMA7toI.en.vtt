00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's see the AWS CLI in action.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.484
I'm on a Mac, so I've navigated to a terminal window.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:10.380
Now, I'm going to demonstrate using the CLI to access and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.595
manage AWS services running in my account from the command line.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.830
I've already downloaded, installed,

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.779
and configured the CLI.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.140
I'm going to show you the version that I'm running.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.399
So the command is AWS minus-minus version.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.074
So this is just a quick look showing the version.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:34.799
Next, let's look at the EC2 instances running in my account.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.914
So this is the command.

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:39.384
First, you use AWS,

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.265
then you use the service.

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:43.005
In this case, EC2,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.505
and then the command.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:46.730
In this case, describe instances.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.259
So this is going to list all of the instances running in my account.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.479
So let me scroll back up.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.829
I have three instances currently running.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.054
So it shows the instance state for monitoring,

00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:03.170
it shows the public DNS name,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.060
lunchtime, IP address, it shows a lot of information related to your EC2 instances.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.070
So let me scroll back down.

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:16.819
Next, let's look at starting an EC2 instance.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.679
So from the command line,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.020
if you have the instance ID,

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:24.560
you can actually start or stop an instance.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.629
So this would be the command.

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:28.694
You would use AWS,

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:31.889
the service name, the command, in this case,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.715
start instances, and then the parameter for instance IDs, and the value.

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.415
So let's click return.

00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:43.520
Notice in this case,

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.439
the instances already running.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.420
If it weren't, it would start up.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.659
You can also stop the instance from the command line.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.140
Next, let's look at publishing a message to an SNS topic from the command line.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.584
So this is the command, AWS,

00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:01.949
the name of the service,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.875
SNS, the action publish.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.915
Then here for the topic ARM parameter,

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:11.270
I'm passing in the ARM for the topic,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.820
and then for the message parameter,

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.224
I'm passing in the message that I want to send.

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:20.044
In this case, publish via command line.

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:21.934
So let's click "Enter".

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:24.949
Because this returns the message ID,

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.919
I can assume that my request was successful.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.614
So let me go to my email client to see if an email came through.

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:35.920
Yes, I see it. I will drag it over here and show it to you.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.554
So this is the message published via command line as expected.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:47.120
Now, let's look at sending a message to the sqsq that's in my account.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.675
So let's look at this command.

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:53.025
It's AWS, the service name,

00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:55.575
the action, which is send message.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:58.019
Here, we need the queue URL.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.615
So this is the URL for the queue.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:02.640
The message body.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.259
Here, on the queue,

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.879
I'm just putting a string message from CLI.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.150
You also need to pass in a group ID,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.094
and that's what I'm doing here and a message deduplication ID.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.974
That's what I'm passing in here.

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:19.034
So let's click return.

00:03:19.034 --> 00:03:22.039
Because I get this message back showing

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.400
the body and the sequence number and the message ID,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.610
I can assume that this request was successful.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.980
One easy way to do that,

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.149
is to list the messages in a queue,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.400
and this is the command that you would use to do that,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.360
AWS, the service, sqs, the action,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.235
receive message, and then for the queue URL parameter,

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:49.610
you would pass in the URL to the queue.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.815
So let's click "Return".

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:56.155
Notice here, it shows one of the messages in the queue.

00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:58.759
Lastly, let's look at listing

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.019
the contents of an S3 bucket via the command line interface.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.330
So this is the command that you would use,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.060
AWS, the name of the service,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.235
S3, the action in this case, LS,

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:12.870
which stands for list,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.134
and then the bucket name.

00:04:15.134 --> 00:04:18.439
So let's click "Return", and notice here,

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:22.344
it lists out all of the objects in the S3 bucket.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.760
So this was a quick look at using the CLI to

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.779
access and manage AWS services from the command line.
