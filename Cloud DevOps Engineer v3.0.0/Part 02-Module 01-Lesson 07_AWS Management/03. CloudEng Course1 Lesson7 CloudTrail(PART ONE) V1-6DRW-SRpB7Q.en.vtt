00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.344
Cloud Trail allows you to audit or review everything that occurs in your AWS account.

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.000
For example, who has logged in,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.179
what services did they access, etc.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.019
Cloud trail does this by recording all of the AWS API calls occurring in your account,

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.460
and delivering a log file to you.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.130
Cloud trail logs actions performed through the AWS management console,

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:29.939
and the AWS, SDK or software development kit.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.810
This means, any application that uses

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.575
this software development kit to interact with AWS services,

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:42.020
command line tools and other AWS services will be logged via Cloud Trail.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.420
This log is very useful should suspicious or unexpected activity occur in your account.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.240
You can also set up alerts and alarms to notify you should certain activities occur.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.520
It is a very useful service.
