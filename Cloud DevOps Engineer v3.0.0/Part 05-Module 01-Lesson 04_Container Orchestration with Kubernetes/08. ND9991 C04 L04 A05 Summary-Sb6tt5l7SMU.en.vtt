00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
All right, I hope I've convinced you that Kubernetes is

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.160
a great solution for containers and how powerful it really is.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.750
You may be thinking to yourself,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.015
"Kubernetes, is this really something I want to run?"

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.480
Hopefully, we can walk through all the different features that we talked

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.220
about and make sure that you understand how capable Kubernetes really is.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
So one, to install Kubernetes really takes just a few minutes.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.385
You can install it using Minikube or you can install it via Docker itself.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:35.495
Second, Kubernetes itself as composed of many different pieces including Cube CTL,

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.300
pods, containers, and clusters.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.440
Google has actually developed all this over many many years and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.615
has actually done all the heavy lifting to

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.135
make sure it works at scale and then open sourced it.

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:51.155
Finally, we talked about monitoring and logging and debugging with Kubernetes.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.320
There's a great integration with Prometheus that

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.405
gives us the ability to look at a dashboard,

00:00:57.405 --> 00:00:58.980
look at specific alerts,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.805
and automatically respond to those alerts.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:05.690
Finally, we talked about auto-scaling with CPU or memory.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.990
So these are things that you have the ability to do with

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.990
Kubernetes and really is one of the key reasons to use

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.620
Kubernetes is that you have this abstraction layer and you're able to actually

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.410
apply auto scale rules without having to tie in to some external system.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.005
It's completely baked into your Kubernetes application.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.429
So in a nutshell,

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.055
Kubernetes is a powerful ecosystem.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:29.990
It can be thought of,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.865
let's say, a MiniCloud itself.

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:36.770
It's really, probably the primary reason that you should be using

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.765
containers is you're leveraging

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.530
the know-how and the expertise of a powerhouse like Google.
