Hello. My name is Noah Gift and I'm the Founder

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.860
of Pragmatic AI Labs and I wrote the book,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.605
Pragmatic AI: An Introduction to Cloud-Based Machine Learning,

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.595
as well as the book, Python for DevOps by O'Reilly.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:15.315
I lecture at Northwestern, UC Berkeley, and UC Davis.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:21.310
Today, I'm going to discuss container orchestration with Kubernetes. Let's get started.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.550
First, we're going to go through and install Kubernetes.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.295
Let's go ahead and pop into that screen and do that.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:33.230
One of the first components to install for Kubernetes is the kubectl command.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.770
You can see on this terminal that we're going to download

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.730
the kubectl command itself from Google.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.144
There's a curl command I operate where I go through and I look at Kubernetes releases,

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:49.250
and then I grab one specifically for my platform.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.280
In this case, it's going to be Darwin or the OS X platform.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.240
When I run this, it goes through and it verifies that I can actually curl a command.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.830
Then next, you can see that I can actually run kubectl to verify that,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.095
in fact, it does work.

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:06.640
If I do the help message,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.330
I have all these options available that allow me to install kubectl.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.975
The second step is to actually install Minikube.

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:19.340
There's also an option of I can install Kubernetes via the Docker framework.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.225
But let's go through and look at the Minikube option.

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:26.240
To install Minikube, the first thing we want to do is make sure

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.410
that the machine I'm running on actually supports virtualization.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.310
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to run this command on OS X

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.310
that looks at all the features that are available for my CPU.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.635
One trick that I'm going to do is I'm going to grep for VMX.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:49.000
What that does is it shows me that in red,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.590
my machine actually supports virtualization.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.915
So great. I can install Minikube.

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.815
Now that I've verified that my machine can run Minikube,

00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:00.770
I'm going to install it via the brew system.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.070
So I'm going to install brew cask install minikube.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.755
Great. Minikube was successfully installed.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:17.670
Now, we're ready to actually begin using Kubernetes.
