00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
Now one of the real main reasons for running Kubernetes is that you want to have

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:10.904
production quality containers and you want to actually run things that are maintainable,

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:14.039
and this is a huge motivation for Kubernetes.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.660
So as a result,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.839
also you're going to want to consider things like monitoring,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.480
logging, and debugging with Kubernetes.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.350
In general, what that means is that you want to have proactive monitoring,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.890
you want to have cluster visibility and capacity planning,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.844
you want to be able to trigger alerts and notifications,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:34.049
and you want to have a metrics dashboard.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.464
So one of the things you can do is you can configure Prometheus.

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:42.734
Prometheus is a monitoring system that integrates very well with Kubernetes.

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:46.914
In general, there's something called Prometheus operator.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:49.924
Essentially, it maps directly into

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.789
the workflow of containers and the workflow of Kubernetes.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.920
So that's the recommended monitoring solution,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.175
and it's something that you can follow up on

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:01.649
by looking at the documentation of our lesson.
