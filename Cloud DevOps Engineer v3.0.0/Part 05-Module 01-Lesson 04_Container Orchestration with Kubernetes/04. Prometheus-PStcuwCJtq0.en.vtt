00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's go ahead and get started with Prometheus,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.590
which is a very popular metrics and alerting solution that's

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.360
often used alongside with containers and Kubernetes.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.555
So let's go ahead and use AWS,

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:21.690
the Cloud9 environment, and we'll use that to actually prototype what we're doing.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.939
As I've mentioned other videos,

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.880
Cloud9 is often a shortcut to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.215
really productive workflows because it simplifies your environment.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:34.440
Especially if you're going to be doing something inside the Cloud,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.210
it really is a great environment.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.740
So I'm going to click on "Cloud9" here.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.370
I've already got some Cloud9 environments opened up.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.800
I'm going to go ahead and click on this "Dockerbuild."

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.005
I was doing some docker work in there.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.070
What I'm going to do to start with is that,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.060
I'm going to go ahead and download my Prometheus client here.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.660
So I'm going to go and find my Prometheus client,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.500
which is going to be in the Prometheus download section.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.150
So let's go ahead and put that in here.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.705
I'm going to go ahead and find this Linux executable. Here we go.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.145
I'll copy the link.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:16.505
Then if I go to this environment,

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:18.385
I can type in wget.

00:01:18.385 --> 00:01:21.920
Just like that. Now when you're watching this video,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.365
your version may be a little bit newer,

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:27.680
but you can go select that version.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.880
That looks like it's successful.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.440
So next up, what I'm going to do here

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.680
is that I'm going to make this window a little bit bigger,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.780
and I'm going to go ahead and look for that directory.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.980
There we go. I'm going to untar it.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.585
So I'm going to run the command tar xvfz,

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:52.170
and then Prometheus and do autocomplete.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.065
Great. That looks like that was able to bring it up there.

00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:03.175
Next up then, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cd into that directory.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:08.285
From here, I'm going to go ahead and create a config file.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:11.040
You'll notice that there's already a default config file.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.050
So I can actually use my editor and take a look at that.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.600
So let's go ahead and look at that config file.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.170
Great. It's going to ask me to view it with a text editor.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.520
I'll go ahead and do that.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.760
Then I'm going to paste in my own configure.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.485
So I'm going to slightly change this one. Here we go.

00:02:30.485 --> 00:02:35.970
Its got Prometheus, and basically it's going to keep track of its own metrics.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.960
So Prometheus is a metrics collection system,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.240
but it also produces its own metrics.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.930
Notice that it says port 9090.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.545
So the Cloud9 environment is safe by default.

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:51.380
So as a result,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.490
I'm going to have to go ahead and clean that up a little bit.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.340
Let's actually make this a little bit bigger.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.700
I'm going to have to clean that up a little bit by opening up a port.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.775
So in order to open up that port and see the traffic import 9090,

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:12.675
I'm going to go ahead and go back to AWS here,

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:15.840
and I'm going to type in ec2,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.080
and I'm going to find in the security group where that actually live.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.065
So I'm going to go down to Security Groups here,

00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:29.930
and I'm going to find the one that says docker in there. Let's see.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.820
I think I can just do a control F docker. There we go.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.770
If I click on it,

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.525
notice that the inbound ports here are only port 22.

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:45.405
So I'm going to need to open up another port,

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:49.305
add a rule, and this rule will be 9090.

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:56.250
So that's, again, the port that's going to serve out the metrics website.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.895
Now that that's open,

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:02.330
I can actually run Prometheus here,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.220
and we can see this thing in action.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.440
So I've saved the config file.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.015
How do I run Prometheus?

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.110
Pretty straight forward.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.835
I just pass it in a config file.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:15.870
So it looks like this./Prometheus --config.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.985
I gave it that yml file.

00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:21.030
There we go. Now it's running the foreground mode.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.840
Foreground mode is great way to observe what's

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.620
happening on your system because you can see the output of the server.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.175
All I have to do now is find out what the IP address is.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:32.480
So how can I do that?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.710
Well I go back to this ec2 console here.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.960
If I go to my Instances,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.865
I can find that instance.

00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:42.350
You can see here that dockerbuild,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.745
you can notice that it's running.

00:04:43.745 --> 00:04:45.245
If I click on it,

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:49.250
I actually can get the publicly available DNS server.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.905
So I'm going to just copy that,

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:54.300
put a tab open here, and paste it in.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.120
Now remember, we told it to open up port 9090.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.975
So I'll need to say colon 9090.

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:03.995
Great. Now that that's running,

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:10.160
what I can do is maybe telling it to create a metrics.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.355
So one of the ways you can make it create metrics is by going to this metrics URL.

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:21.910
Let's go through here and let's go back here.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.325
I believe we can go to metrics,

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:29.610
is the URL metrics, there we go.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.430
Now you can see a generated metrics.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.485
So every time I call this page, that was 1,

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:40.475
2, 3, 4, 5, itself create metrics.

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:47.210
So let's go back here and see if we can put in a command in

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:54.035
the expression browser right here that will give us back those requests.

00:05:54.035 --> 00:05:55.355
So I'm going to click on that,

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:59.090
and then I'm going to say execute.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.670
You can see in fact it showed a bunch of values.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.645
So it was able to generate two metrics elements for each one of those calls that I did.

00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:11.240
Another way to look at metrics inside,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.890
is to actually go on the graphs section here.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.205
If you click on graphs,

00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:21.140
you also can go through and look at

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.400
different visualizations as well and look at the different counter.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.090
So really this interface here,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.300
and let's pick one of the metrics here,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.889
which is, let's see,

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.860
maybe the HTTP requests or something like that.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.090
We execute that.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.755
If I graph it,

00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:45.630
I can go ahead and see those requests.
