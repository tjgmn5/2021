00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.934
Queue is a data structure that holds requests, sometimes called messages.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:09.375
A queue is similar in concept to waiting in line at a department store.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.785
People join the line,

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.585
and wait their turn to checkout.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.265
Similarly, messages join a queue and wait their turn to be processed.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.670
Messages in a queue are commonly processed in order,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.715
first-in, first-out or FIFO.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:26.969
Let's say you have a money transfer app with

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.599
millions of users sending funds back and forth,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.370
instead of making a user wait for

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.209
confirmation while money is being transferred through the platform,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.954
you let them know their request was submitted and allow them to go about their day.

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:45.829
Behind the scenes, you place the money transfer request on a queue,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.684
and process that requests when system resources are available.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:52.580
Since the money transfer process along with

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.894
doing security checks could take a while to process.

00:00:55.895 --> 00:01:01.365
The benefit of using a queue is that the user doesn't have to sit there waiting.

00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:06.844
The use of a messaging queue will help improve performance and scalability.

00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:12.289
The use of asynchronous processing where a user doesn't wait for a response,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.990
improves the overall user experience.
