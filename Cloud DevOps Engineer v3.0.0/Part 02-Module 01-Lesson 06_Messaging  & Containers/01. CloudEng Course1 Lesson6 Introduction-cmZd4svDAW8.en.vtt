00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.233
Now that you know how to route users to your website and handle the incoming traffic,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:10.664
you will want the ability to notify or alert your users when certain events happen.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:14.849
Did you know there are cloud services that make notification easy?

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.170
As you add additional features to your travel blogging website like

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.625
the ability to search or even the ability to make a hotel reservation,

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:28.530
you might consider adopting a container technology like Docker to help you

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.899
bundle your web application package that can easily move from environment to environment.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.600
In this lesson, I will teach you how to send

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.335
notifications to your users using cloud services.

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:44.884
I will also show you how two systems communicate using messaging.

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:48.170
We will wrap up with you learning about containers and why

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.545
they are so useful for modern application development.

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.060
So let's get started.
