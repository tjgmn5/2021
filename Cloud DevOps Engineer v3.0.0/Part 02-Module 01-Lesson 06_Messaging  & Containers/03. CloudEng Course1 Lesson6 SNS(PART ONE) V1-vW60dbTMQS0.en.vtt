Amazon Simple Notification Service or SNS is

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.419
AWS cloud service that allows you to

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.945
send notifications to the users of your applications.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.300
SNS allows you to decouple

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.019
the notification logic from being embedded in your applications,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.689
and allows notifications to be published to a large number of subscribers.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.920
SNS uses the publish/subscribe model.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.535
This means, that in order for your users to be notified,

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:33.359
they have to sign up or subscribe first.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.295
Subscribers can be a person or another AWS service.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:42.225
Notifications can be sent to end-users using mobile push,

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.550
text messages, and e-mail.
