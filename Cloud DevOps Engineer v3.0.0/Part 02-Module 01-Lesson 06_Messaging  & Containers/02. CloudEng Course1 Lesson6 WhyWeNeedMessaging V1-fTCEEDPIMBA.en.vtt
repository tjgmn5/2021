There are oftentimes that users of

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.004
your applications need to be notified when certain events happen.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:11.339
For example, if a large withdrawal is made from your bank account,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.964
it would be nice to receive a text message.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.100
What if someone from outside of the US

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.895
logs into your Netflix account which happened to me by the way.

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:25.079
My receipt of an email alert allowed me to act quickly.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:32.129
Notifications such as text messages or emails can be sent through services in the Cloud.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.700
The use of the Cloud offers benefits like lower cost,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.370
increase storage, and flexibility.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.729
Through Cloud services, you can send

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.515
notifications and even track the life cycle of those notifications.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.799
Messaging is a form of notifications,

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.984
but instead of a human as the recipient of the message, an application is.

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:59.734
Messaging typically occurs between Internet-based applications and devices.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:03.530
One system can send a message to another system.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.120
We will talk more about this concept when we discuss queuing technology.
