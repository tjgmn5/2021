00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Here we have a CloudFormation script that we're going to use to verify that

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.929
we can deploy infrastructure as code through a script.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:08.250
But before we do that,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.699
I want to go to the console and show you how to do it manually so that

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.464
you understand the reasoning behind why are we doing this.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.160
So let's go to the AWS Console.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.189
Here we are in the main screen for the AWS console,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.390
I'm going to click on VPC.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:33.750
I'll select our VPC from our region and I'll click the Create VPC button.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.659
In the name tag, I'll just give it a random name.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.379
I'll call it UdacityVPC1.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:51.549
On the CIDR block, I'm just going to use 10.0.1.0/16.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.929
You don't need to worry about this value right now.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.560
This is just a random IP address space

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.230
that we're going to use for our simulated resource.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.030
We see we get an error message.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.359
It says it must be a valid Ipv4 CIDR range.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.000
This is very important that we get this message,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.209
because what this means is as something

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:17.914
that could happen if you're actually doing it in the real world,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:24.290
you would potentially have an error situation because we're typing a value.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.660
So let's correct that.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.269
Want to change this into a zero,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.430
and now we get it to work.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.660
Now, right away, you saw one of the benefits of

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.054
having a scripted infrastructure is that if we get an error message,

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:44.720
that's only going to have ambiguous,

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.775
I'm manually typing in values.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:53.270
If you have a scripted infrastructure as code that you have run over and over again,

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:57.259
everything should be fine because you know you already deployed in tests and it works,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.180
so when you deploy in production,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.695
it's going to be fine.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:04.489
So what we're going to do now is we're going to get rid of this resource that we

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.210
created and we're going to do the same thing but we're going to use the script.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.290
As you'll see, it's a lot more predictable and less risk of making an error.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.070
So I'll click select my VPC that I just created.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.709
I click Delete, and that was deleted right away.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.290
Now we'll go back to our code editor.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.134
Looking at our code here,

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:36.734
you'll see here in line 6 is a VPC.

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.805
We're creating the exact same thing that we just did,

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:43.145
and we have the exact same value for the CIDR block.

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:45.950
Again don't worry about what any of these means at this time

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.889
because we're going to go over in detail in the next lesson.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.660
But for right now we're trying to create

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.835
these resource and that's what we're going to do.

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:57.260
We're going to take this file,

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.439
we're going to execute it, and we're going to see if it creates the exact same thing.
