00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.559
Okay. Now that we have our script tested, verified, and deployed,

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.239
now you can see the real benefits of infrastructure as code.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.019
You don't run into the risk of forgetting something,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.189
or missing a stab, or mistyping something.

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.509
This is the time when you would need to be able

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.190
to do this over and over again not just for a single resource,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.260
like we just did, but for many resources.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.655
It could be hundreds.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.155
So the only way to visualize this is through a diagram.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.910
So in the next lesson, what we're going to do is,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.384
we're going to be able to start creating

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:38.449
our own diagrams and be able to read them because in the real world,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.470
what you're going to see is somebody is going to hand you

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.445
a Cloud architecture diagram and you need to be able to understand what everything means,

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:52.340
all the containers, all the specific symbols that represent infrastructure.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.795
Once you understand those and create your own,

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:59.234
then we're going to go into actually turning that into code.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:02.740
But right now, let's just focus on the diagrams.
