00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.175
In the past, we have seen development and operations be a completely separate entities.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.915
That's less than ideal.

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.954
Developers will create code,

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.759
the code needs to be deployed to production,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.379
and because of that operation needs to communicate with developers.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.269
Operational, if you don't know,

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.719
is the part of IT that manages,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.094
monitors, configures, and deploys software.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.410
Their job is to make sure that the software for the business

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.009
is producing as suspected and it's running at top performance.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.079
Now, software developers, what they do is they'll take

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.299
a requirement sheet and then they will turn it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:44.384
into a piece of software that gets deployed.

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:46.799
Now, they'll pass information to

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:52.424
operationals folks that need to deploy the software and make sure it's running properly.

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:57.369
There's usual communication gaps in between those two groups of people.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.284
The job of development and operation,

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:01.609
now in the world of DevOps,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.640
is to integrate each other and get everything working

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.790
together as a team and not as two separate entities.
