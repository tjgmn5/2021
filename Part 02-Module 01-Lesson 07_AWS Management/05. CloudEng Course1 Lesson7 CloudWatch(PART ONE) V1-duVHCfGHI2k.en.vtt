CloudWatch is a service that monitors resources and applications that run on AWS.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.189
There are several useful features like collecting and tracking metrics,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.024
collecting and monitoring log files,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:18.375
setting alarms and creating triggers to run your AWS resources,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:22.245
and reacting to changes in your AWS resources.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:24.929
The ability to review log files is

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.009
crucial during the development and support of applications.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.444
I routinely use CloudWatch logs written from my lambda functions,

00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:37.460
to diagnose issues and monitor application flow.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.020
I've also use CloudWatch as a trigger for my lambda functions,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.170
causing a lambda to run on a given schedule.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.660
CloudWatch is a flexible and powerful tool that provides several options.
