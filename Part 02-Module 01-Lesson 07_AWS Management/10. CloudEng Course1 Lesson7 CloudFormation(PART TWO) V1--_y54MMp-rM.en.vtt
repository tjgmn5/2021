00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.194
Let's see CloudFormation in action.

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:06.089
From the AWS management console page,

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.980
type CloudFormation, this brings you to the CloudFormation dashboard.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.964
I want to show you the designer first.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:18.629
The AWS CloudFormation designer is the graphic tool for creating,

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:22.410
viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.059
So with this designer,

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:29.114
you can diagram your template resources using a drag and drop interface,

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:34.379
and then actually edit the details using JSON or a YAML.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.655
So for example, let's say I wanted to stand up an auto scaling group.

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:42.755
I would simply drag and drop it over here.

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:45.050
Within that auto-scaling group,

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:47.884
we will need an EC2 instance,

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:50.045
drag and drop it over here.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:53.719
Now, there is a dependency for the auto-scaling group.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.134
There have to be instances running.

00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:03.679
So let's show that dependency by using this arrow, here we go.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.180
So this is a quick look.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.750
Let me show you an existing CloudFormation template that I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.474
created using this visual designer to actually create an S3 instance.

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:15.604
So I'm going to open that file.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:20.594
It's something I saved locally, open.

00:01:20.594 --> 00:01:24.935
So notice here I've dragged and dropped an S3 bucket.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:28.745
So let's click on it and click on components.

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.885
Notice the JSON here on line three,

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:33.859
it shows the name of the bucket.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.954
Here on line six it shows the access control for the bucket,

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:39.545
so the bucket is public.

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:43.534
Now, let's close this designer by clicking on ''Close''.

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:48.769
Let's take a look at the stack that was deployed to create an S3 bucket.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:51.170
So once I close the designer,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.364
it brings me back to the stack details page.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.834
So this is the very first stack that I'm going to click on,

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.829
and click on "Events".

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.269
This shows here on this second row that the S3 bucket was created,

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:08.210
because I have a status of create complete.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.415
Let's navigate to S3 to see if a bucket was actually created and click on "Services",

00:02:15.414 --> 00:02:17.504
and we can go to S3.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.144
Let's sort this by the most recent first,

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:25.909
and notice here this is the bucket that was created by the CloudFormation stack.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.349
Notice this portion here that is the name of the bucket that we identified.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.430
You can stand up all types of resources through CloudFormation in your hands-on lab,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.460
you will use CloudFormation to create an S3 bucket.
