00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.544
Up to this point,

00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:07.200
we've only accessed AWS via the AWS management console in a web browser.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.839
But you can also access your AWS account via the command line interface or CLI.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.910
The AWS CLI allows you to access and control services running in

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.804
your AWS account from the command line for Windows or from a terminal window for Mac.

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:27.329
There are some instances where features are available through

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.989
the CLI but not through the AWS management console.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.619
In my experience, the features that are unavailable via

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:38.699
the AWS management console eventually make their way there.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.320
To use the CLI,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.850
you simply download, install, and configure it.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.939
You may find that you prefer using the CLI instead of

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:51.989
the AWS management console to control services in your account.
