It's exciting to see your travel blogging website up and running in the Cloud.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.519
Your website has great performance and security

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.105
measures in place to protect your site and users.

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.940
You just found out the other day that you have over

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.809
one million daily users reading your blog articles,

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.989
searching, and even booking hotels through your site.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.384
Very exciting.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:28.500
But someone from your support team just notified you that a handful of users are

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.750
seeing where error messages when they

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.719
enter their credit card information to complete a booking.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.579
You've now transitioned into support mode.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.324
You'll need to use tools to help you support and manage your site.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:43.910
You'll need to do things like review log files to troubleshoot

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.109
production issues or review all of the activity in your account.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.649
In this lesson, I will show you tools that you can use to

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.159
help you troubleshoot and audit your cloud applications.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.149
I will even show you how to efficiently manage your resources.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.739
So let's get started.
