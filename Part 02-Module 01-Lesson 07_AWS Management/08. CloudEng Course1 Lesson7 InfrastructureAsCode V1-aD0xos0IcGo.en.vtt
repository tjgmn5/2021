00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.109
Have you heard the term infrastructure as code?

00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:06.634
This is where you stand up servers, databases,

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.099
runtime parameters, resources, etc,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.464
based on scripts that you write.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:18.615
Essentially, you are scripting out infrastructure which turns infrastructure into code.

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:21.929
This is a time-saving feature because it allows you to

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.039
provision or stand up resources in a reproducible way.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.649
You are able to manage a collection of

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.820
related resources and treat them as one logical unit.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.420
Let's say, in order to set up a development environment,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.149
you have to do these steps;

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.905
configure a VPC security group,

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:43.515
launch an EC2 instance,

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:50.210
create load balancers, create an RDS instance, and create auto-scaling.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.965
Instead of manually having to set up each of these resources individually,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:59.900
you can write a script to create the resources for you in a repeatable way.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.620
Infrastructure as Code is a great time saving feature.
