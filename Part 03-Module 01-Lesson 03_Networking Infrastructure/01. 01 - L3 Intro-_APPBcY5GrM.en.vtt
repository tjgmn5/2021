00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Hi. In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:03.870
we created other cider for structure diagram.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.080
Now, we're going to go over the exact same components.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.945
However, this attempt is not going to be artistic.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:11.850
Instead, we're going to use the diagram,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.289
I'll say, visual reference,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.965
to write the CloudFormation code that builds a infrastructure.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.145
But before we do, let's go ahead and create a workflow,

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.870
and go over some basics.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.055
Here we are in Visual Studio Code,

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:28.710
and we're going to be able to see our diagram because conveniently,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.814
Visual Studio Code supports the display of graphics,

00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:33.495
even though is a text editor,

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.700
it's very convenient for us in this case.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.125
You'll see right now,

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:44.510
the web architecture that we tried to do yesterday.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.310
Now, of course, this is a lot cleaner and better organized than the attempt that we did.
