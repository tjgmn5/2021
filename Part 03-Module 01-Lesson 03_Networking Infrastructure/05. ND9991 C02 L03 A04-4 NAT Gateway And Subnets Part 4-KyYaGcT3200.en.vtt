00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
This is also a good opportunity to introduce the DependsOn clause from conformation.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.865
What this means is that if you need

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.580
a specific logic for your CloudFormation to

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.925
wait on the creation of another resource on the same script,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:23.235
this will not execute because it depends on the other resource.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.784
So until the other resource is completed,

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:27.810
this will be placed on hold.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.080
So this is a good hint for CloudFormation on what to build

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.560
first in your script and in which order to build things.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.245
So in this case, we have an InternetGatewayAttachment.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:41.045
Once it is attached and properly working,

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:45.025
then it will go and do any IP allocation.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.995
Because a public IP address makes no sense,

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:52.560
unless of course, you have a way to reach it.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.000
So this is pretty straightforward.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.535
There's no parameters here.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:02.690
It just makes a reference to where you want to deploy this gateway.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.585
In this case we're referring to public subnet 1 and 2,

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.325
which we know they're already created.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.925
So there's really not much to it.

00:01:09.925 --> 00:01:12.745
Of course, the GetAttribute,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.930
which is the first time we're seeing it,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.540
it just pulls the IP address that we just

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.080
allocated in the previous two resource creations here.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.240
So let's go ahead and execute this as well.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.255
We save our file.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:32.950
We're going to do another UpdateStack.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.365
We have another error. This time is a YAML not well-formed error.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.600
I have an idea of what it is,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.610
and I'll tell you probably as you can see,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.620
you see PrivateSubnet2 here,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.810
and this resource is basically inside PrivateSubnet2.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.460
You don't want that. So we're going to go ahead and select that and we're going to shift,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.235
tab, to move it back to it.

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:04.285
It has to be indented properly.

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:07.490
This time is aligned with the last resource that we created,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.370
so that should resolve the issue. Let's try that again.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.670
That said, we get a confirmation that the StackID worked.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.910
Keep that in mind. YAML is a very picky format.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
So it's a great example that we got this error.
