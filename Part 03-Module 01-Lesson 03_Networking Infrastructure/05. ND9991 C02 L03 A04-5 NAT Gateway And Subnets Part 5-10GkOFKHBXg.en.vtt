00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
Back in our console here,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.255
if we go down in this Menu bar,

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.475
we see that it says NAT gateways. Let's see.

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:13.080
We see two in a status pending,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.920
probably the ones that we just trigger right now so let's see the creation process.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.855
It might take awhile. You see they have IP addresses that are private,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.180
but we don't want that.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.775
We need the public facing IP addresses as well.

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:34.180
So we have to wait a little bit for this resources to be created.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.640
Depending on the complexity of the resource,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.680
it'll starts to take more and more time.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.520
Let's go back to CloudFormation, update in progress.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.865
We'll click our infrastructure and this is what it looks like.

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:07.365
It's confirming that is creating our NAT gateways and that is the workflow.

00:01:07.365 --> 00:01:10.780
What we do is we continue to create

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.065
resources little by little until we have our entire picture.

00:01:15.065 --> 00:01:17.560
So going back to here,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.250
the next topic of conversation is once this is complete, it's going to be routing.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.590
This is probably a very critical portion.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.880
We're going to create route tables and once we have those route tables,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.180
we're going to create rules to allow traffic to flow in and out of

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.500
our public subnets and we're also going to have rules for

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.970
the traffic to flow outbound only from my private subnets.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.210
We have no interest in capturing inbound Internet traffic

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.705
from the Internet gateway into our private subnets.

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:53.854
In fact, the private subnets,

00:01:53.854 --> 00:01:55.865
they're not even going to go outside directly.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:59.420
They're going to go just and hit the NAT gateways that we're creating,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.700
and that's the only way that they can reach the outside.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.370
Now, our stock has reached the status update complete. Let's take a look.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.565
We have confirmation that now we have our NAT gateways created.

00:02:35.565 --> 00:02:39.040
That's perfect. Before we go back,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.285
let's take a look. Make sure they're there.

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:45.045
Go back to VPC, scroll down to NAT gateway,

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:47.230
click on that and sure enough now they

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.920
have elastic IPs and they're created and they're functional.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250
Now, we need to find a way to test them but before we do,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.260
of course, we need to create routing for them.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.120
Now the question would be,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.770
if I created a VPC,

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.480
it's understood that there has to be

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.200
some routing and the answer is yes, you would be correct.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.250
There is routing provided to all VPCs just as soon as you create them.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.255
However, the default routing does not account for you

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:23.440
creating subnets that are going to be used for whatever purpose.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.830
For example, a public one is different than a private one

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.140
and the default routing rules provided are not going to consider that.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.500
If you need to know the default rules for routing in a VPC,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.940
they are to allow traffic within the VPC.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.410
Any resource will be able to talk to each other and that's okay

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.410
because everything that you have in your public subnets or your private subnets,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.195
those are still your servers on services.

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.705
So yes, it's okay for them to be able to talk to one another.

00:03:53.705 --> 00:03:57.050
But the tricky part is when you want to talk to the outside world,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.875
which is where your data may be exposed to a security risk.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:04.980
That's why we need these routing rules that we're going to get to right now.
