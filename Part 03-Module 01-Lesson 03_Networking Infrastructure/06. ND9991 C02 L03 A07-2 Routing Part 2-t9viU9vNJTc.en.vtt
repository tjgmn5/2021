00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.045
The very next resort is a subnet route table association.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:11.579
What that means is we do have a route table in the BPC and it has rules,

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.345
but the BPC could have a lot of subnet,

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.040
not just 1, 2, 4,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.915
10, it could have many subnets.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:24.090
So you need to specify this rule that we just created to which subnet does it apply.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.760
In this case, we are applying a two public subnet 1.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.630
Following that is another association where

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.690
applying the same rule to public subnet number 2.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.370
Now, we're going to create another route table and probably another one.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.230
This is for the private routing,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.460
so let's get into that part.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.180
So we create that route table and right away,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.290
we create a rule that say, ''Hey,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.745
when you're routing traffic to the wildcard address which is 000,

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.800
this time, I want you to send it to the NAT gateway.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.615
I don't want you to be able to exit to the outside.''

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:14.340
This will keep the traffic for the private subnets within the BPC.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.825
Also something to remember,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:21.890
the private BPC servers are not going to have a public address.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.725
So even if they were placed on a public subnet,

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:28.740
there's no way to access them if they have no IP address.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.749
Now, we do this association,

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:38.290
we associate private subnet 1 with this rule that we just created,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:47.235
and then we do the same thing for private subnet number 2.

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:54.025
Now, you might notice that we have created an additional routing table. Why is that?

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:57.005
It seems unnecessary because we just could create

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:01.820
the same rule and a single route table and apply it to both private subnets.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.645
That would be ideal.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.080
You're going to have to trust me on this one,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.650
this is for future expansion.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.475
When you could have more subnets and more complex rules,

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:15.770
you don't want to just have a single place where you put

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.515
a rule and you could affect and break something else.

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.719
So this is something that seems unnecessary

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.000
right now but it will help you with future expansion.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.900
This is all the resources we're doing right now,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.460
so we're going to save and execute.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.610
So I'll hit "Save" and update our Stack one more time.
