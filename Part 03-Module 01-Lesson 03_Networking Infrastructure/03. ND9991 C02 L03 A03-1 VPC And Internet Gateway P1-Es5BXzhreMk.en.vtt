00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.395
I do have a file here that contains the necessary commands.

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:06.570
However, we are going to be going over,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.250
I'm building this step-by-step.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.000
We're not just going to take the file and run it and then explain it after the fact,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.810
we're going to go and build it, resource by resource.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:25.755
Let's take a look. We obviously going to start out with our VPC, which is the foundation.

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:27.855
We already have an AWS account.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.450
So what we need to do is create our VPC

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.060
and then we're going to start deploying resources on top of that.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.280
We're going to create a new file.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.810
In this new file, I'm going to go back to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.390
my source document and we're just going to take

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.000
a portion of it so that we can build in and discuss it as we go.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.350
In this case, we're going to start with just a VPC.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.350
I'll select the VPC,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.620
copy and go back to our file,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.970
the new file that we created.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.340
I'm going to remove the description.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.390
We don't need that at this time.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.210
We're going to make sure our text editor is in YAML format.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.020
We're going to save this file and we're going to start working on it.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.860
I'll hit "Save," we'll give it

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:07.100
a meaningful name here, ourinfra.yml.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.590
I'll save it. Now let's take a look at this.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.360
The first thing you're going to see is that we have a parameter,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.130
something that we haven't discussed yet.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.765
So let's talk about parameters for a moment.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.800
A parameter is something that you're going to use

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.395
to pass values to your CloudFormation script.

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:26.000
If you look at the screen,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.520
it says the VpcCIDR has a default value of 10.0.0.0/16.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.410
As a default value, that's okay,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.430
but we want to have the option of changing that value.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.235
Never hardcode values into your

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:46.100
affirmation scripts because what that means is you're going to have to go in

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.775
there and possibly change it and risk

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:54.420
making a typo in a already tested script, and you could break it.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.620
So if we have a separate file where we have these values

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.550
like the CIDR for the VPC or the name for

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.600
load balancing or something that you can conveniently change without

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.620
having to touch the script at all, is ideal.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.410
So that's why we have a separate parameter file so that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.410
we have these values away from the script.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.860
So let's see how we do this here.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.630
First of all, we're going to need a parameter file,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.520
obviously, so that we can pass these values.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.670
I do have one here,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.895
which is the real one that we're going to use,

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:36.490
and we're going make a simplified copy for our purpose right now.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.870
Make a copy, drop it in a new file.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.330
This file is going to be in JSON format.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.870
The parameter file does not support YAML format at the time of this recording,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.960
so it's going to be a JSON formatted document.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.450
I'll hit "Save" and give it a name,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.780
ourinfra-params, and then save.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.610
So we have two parameters in this file.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.325
One, we're calling environment name,

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.340
and you'll see why in a second.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.030
We're just going to call

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.330
this parameter environment name and provide a value of Udacity project.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.690
You can then put whatever value you want in there,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.570
but you'll see why is that important later

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.150
on and the CIDR for the VPC that we just discussed.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.310
Now we have this in a file where we can change it without ever

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.435
having to touch our CloudFormation script, or risk-breaking something.

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:53.000
So let's go back to the script that we're building,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.590
which is our YAML file.
