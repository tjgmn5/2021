00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
We have two parameters declared in our parameter section,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.610
which is the EnvironmentName. We have a description.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.670
This description is really just for us,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.350
not really provides any function audit.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.220
This is just for you to remember what the perimeter is

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.195
for and it gives you an opportunity to provide a default value,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.880
like you see here for the VpcCIDR.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.230
Now, remember what I said,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.570
in this case, we don't have a resources section.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.625
So if we try to run this right now,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.275
it would say, "Hey, that's great,

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.940
we have a parameter section,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.460
but there are no resources, so it would fail.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.240
In a programming language,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.380
if you actually write an empty code file,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.640
the compiler will not complain.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.005
It will tell you everything's fine.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:49.010
In this case, it will fail if you don't actually have any resources.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.870
So let's add some resources.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.800
In this case, we're just trying to build a VPC,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.930
so let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.750
We'll go back to our reference document here and look for the VPC resource.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.430
We're going to copy this, bring it over to our document.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.355
Now we have a VPC resource and it's referencing

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:37.765
that parameter that we talked about. Let's try to run it.

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:39.370
We're probably going to run into some errors,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.730
but that's ideal in this case,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.640
especially at an early stage where we don't have too much code to troubleshoot,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.980
it's perfect to run into some basic error.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.710
So let's see what happens if we try to execute this.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.310
I'll hit "Save." Now let's see.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.355
So if we remember our script,

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:08.540
the create.sh, and we're going to pass the stack name,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.160
ourdemoinfrastructure, and we're going to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.785
pass the file name that we just created for the infrastructure,

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:23.400
our infra.yml, and the matching parameter file.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.380
Now, let's just see what happens.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.965
We get a stack ID returned to us.

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:36.215
What that means in this case is we didn't get an error.

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.240
Everything worked as expected.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.740
Let's go to the console to verify that it's doing something.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.540
We see that the status is creating

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.320
progress and now it switches to create complete. Let's take a look.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.310
There's the VPC that we created.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.450
So far, there's nothing.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.725
It's just a VPC networking container.

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:15.950
So now we're going to start adding subnets to it.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.320
Actually, before we do that,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.050
let's go ahead and connect an internet gateway

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.870
to our VPC so I can explain how that works.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.740
Going back to our reference document,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.380
we have an Internet gateway and we have an Internet gateway attachment.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.350
This is why referencing the documentation is very important,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.420
because if you think that you need an Internet gateway based on your diagram, yes,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.950
you do need an Internet gateway,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.050
but once you read the documentation,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.180
you're going to see that it says, "By the way,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.500
if you just create it,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.170
it's not going to be associated to any VPC".

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.855
So you need to create another resource which is

00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:07.180
a gateway attachment or you're going to take

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.450
this Internet gateway and associate it with the VPC that you want.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.780
Otherwise, it will just be an Internet gateway that is not connected to any network,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.235
so it's not useful to you.

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:19.115
So in this case, we need two resources.

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:21.620
Let's take a look. It's going to be

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.285
this gateway attachment and the Internet gateway itself.

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:31.505
Remember, an Internet gateway is just a resource so that you can have access to

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:36.515
inbound and outbound network traffic from the outside into your private Cloud.

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:42.300
Let's make it work. I'll copy this over

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.850
to our file and I'll drop it over here.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.180
Probably, this formatting is not ideal.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.150
Let me move this over and Shift,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.215
Tab to move back.

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:04.560
Now it's aligned properly with the VPC here.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.775
So the first thing is the creation of the Internet gateway.

00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:10.610
You see, the resource type is Internet gateway.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.965
We just gave it a name of Internet gateway and we're providing tags.

00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:18.240
This is the first time, I believe,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240
where we're using tags for something useful.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.490
It's not just a label anymore.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.265
Tags, which in this case are referencing the parameter that we call EnvironmentName.

00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:33.050
Now you see things start to make sense.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.400
We have this EnvironmentName,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.130
which we're going to call UdacityProject,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.910
and we use the reference function from CloudFormation,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.225
the exclamation point, a ref,

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:48.755
will go and substitute the value here from the parameter.

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:54.720
So you're going to have a tag that says name equals UdacityProject ".

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.540
So if you have 100 internet gateways,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.680
or 100 VPCs, or 100 of whatever resource.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.830
When you see the name tag that says, UdacityProject,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.670
it's going to remind you, this is part of that specific infrastructure that we created.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.655
Once the resource is created,

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:19.890
we'll create an additional resource,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.345
which is the attachment.

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:25.145
It's really just a functionality to associate the VPC.

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:27.515
In this case, we also do a ref.

00:06:27.515 --> 00:06:31.580
This is the first time that we're using the reference function not for a parameter.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.635
We're using the reference function to refer to another resource by name.

00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:38.900
In this case, the name is VPC,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.935
which is the first resource that we created.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:47.720
It's right here. So it will automatically pass the VPC ID to

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.270
this attachment so the Internet gateway will know for

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.300
sure which VPC it's associated with.
