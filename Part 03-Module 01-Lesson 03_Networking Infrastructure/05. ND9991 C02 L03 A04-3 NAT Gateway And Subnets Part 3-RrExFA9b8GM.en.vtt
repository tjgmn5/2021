00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.024
So going back to our reference diagram,

00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:08.805
now we have an Internet gateway,

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:10.440
we have subnets created.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.270
We have four of those subnets created.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.999
So let's continue adding to our infrastructure.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.820
I believe the next step would be to allow

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.030
NAT gateways to be able to route

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.465
traffic for our private subnets while keeping them private.

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:27.600
We need to place those in our public subnets.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.920
So let's do that portion now.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.745
That also going to involve plenty of routing.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:36.190
So going back to our reference.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.610
We're going to start with our NAT gateways.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.375
We're not going to do routing.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.760
Just a second, let's just set up the NAT gateways.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.565
We're going to copy this over to our file and paste it here.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.309
Now, in addition to two NAT gateway resources,

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:11.290
you're going to notice that there's two,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.585
all the resources here called EIP. What does that mean?

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.870
EIP stands for Elastic IP.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.520
This is an IP allocation that you can do.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.170
Is just exactly what it sounds.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.085
You make a request to get an IP address and that IP address belongs to you.

00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:29.540
So the question is,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.320
why not just deploy the NAT gateway and allow Amazon

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.340
to assign any random IP because anyways is a public IP,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.800
so I don't really care what the number is.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.185
The recent one you want to allocate your own IPs

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:48.860
is because once you allocate it for yourself is never going to change.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.260
If a NAT gateway is running by itself,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.520
not just a NAT gateway,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.445
any resource on Amazon is disposable.

00:01:55.445 --> 00:02:00.275
So even for a simple maintenance reason or a restart,

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.184
you could end up with a different IP on that resource,

00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:05.900
and that could throw off anything that

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.110
you have that depends on that particular IP address.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.185
If you need a public IP that will never change,

00:02:12.185 --> 00:02:16.430
make sure you have an allocation for an Elastic IP.
