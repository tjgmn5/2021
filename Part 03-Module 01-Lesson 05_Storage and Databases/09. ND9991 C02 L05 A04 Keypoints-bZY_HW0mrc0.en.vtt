00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.945
Here are the key points and takeaways that we're going to have from this lesson.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.225
Remember to use S3 to store your config files, media file,

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:13.035
or log files because your servers may come and go because of auto scaling reasons.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.260
Also, remember that your servers don't really need credentials.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010
You can assign an IAM role which is a set of temporary credentials,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.670
so they can access your S3 resources when needed.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.870
Always prefer to use RDS as opposed to install on your own database in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.780
an EC2 instance simply because RDS provides

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.469
so much more value to use such as automatic maintenance,

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.570
and patches, and backups.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.370
So you don't have to worry about those things,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.310
and doing it yourself if you install your own server.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.950
So always prefer RDS when possible.
