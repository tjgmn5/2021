00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
So here I am inside Visual Studio code.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.465
You're going to ignore the code for right now

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.900
because we're going to be working on the terminals here.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.810
What I want to do first is talk about the AWS CLI tool.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.090
I'm going to type AWS.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.780
This is the way you verify AWS dash dash version.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.195
That's how you verify whether you have it or not.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.130
If you don't have it, that's okay.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.335
We can come back here to the browser.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:36.340
I'm going to open a new tab and type AWS CLI tool.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.130
The very first link I'm going to click on that.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.800
This is where you would install is pretty simple to install,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.049
as you can see that you just would do pip install AWS CLI,

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.680
and if you're running Windows there's an install

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.275
available that you just download and get it running.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.410
So it's really a very trivial task here.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.520
This is the tool that we're going to be using to allow us

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.035
to access basically the same thing that we're doing in the AWS console,

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:10.850
but from the command line just typing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.105
commands which is something that we can later script.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:20.510
So let's go back to Visual Studio code here on the terminal.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.720
Now what I want to do here I will type AWS configure.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.445
This is where I would type those values that we just got.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:34.580
So let's go back to our browser here.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.130
I'll take the API key,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.230
I'll do a copy,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.610
and then come back here and paste the value.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.280
I'll do the same for the secret key.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.760
So you can see it automatically selects so you don't have to worry about that.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.260
I'll click copy and paste.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.280
Now for the region, I'm going to pick US West two,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.210
this is a specific to the region that we

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.005
discuss that would be Oregon in the United States.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:26.660
The output format is not relevant for our case so we just leave it as none.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.950
That's all these steps are really necessary as long

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.410
as you have Internet access and those two keys,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.525
you're all set to use this tool.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:38.475
Now the question is, How we verify is working?

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:43.830
Usually do aws s3 ls which

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.140
will list my s3 buckets or my storage buckets in AWS.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.490
If we get any kind of error,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.925
we wouldn't know right now if we if we mistype the API key or the secret key.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.895
As you can see we get a response immediately.

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:01.610
So that means our tool is working.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.680
If you have any problems there,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.870
you would get an error something that says,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.150
"Access denied or invalid key."

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
Those are the most common errors that you'll see especially if you forget

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.220
to copy a character while you were doing the select copy and paste.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.160
If that's the case just go back,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.090
check the values and if they're not proper you can just always destroy those values

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.215
and do the process again of creating another user which will give you API keys.

00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:38.840
By the way, you can have a maximum of two keys active at any one time per user.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.225
So if you don't want to have to recreate the user every single time,

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:51.570
you just go in there and we'll see that now how to add additional keys to the same user.
