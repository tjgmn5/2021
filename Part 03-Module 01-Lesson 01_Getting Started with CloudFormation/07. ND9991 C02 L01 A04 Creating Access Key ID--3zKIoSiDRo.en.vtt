00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.605
All right. So here we are in the AWS management console,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.920
and what I'm going to try to do here is just create

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.620
a user that's going to allow us to do the work that we're trying to do.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.285
As I mentioned before, the console is great for us to verify our work.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:22.440
We can come here and check everything is working properly.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.080
But ideally, we're going to be writing code.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.165
We have no intention of clicking our way to an infrastructure.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:34.125
We want to be sure that we can run it and redrawn as many times as needed,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.760
and the only way to do that is by using obviously a script.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.170
So in order to be able to interact with AWS without the console,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.480
we need a set of API keys.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.430
So let's go ahead and get that done.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.680
Here in the console, I'll type I am,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.050
just Identity and Access Management.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.580
This is from the main screen.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.895
In this case, you don't have to worry about which region you're operating on.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:08.630
Because as you can see here I am does not require a region of selection.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.510
Everything you do here is going to be global.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.070
Okay? So we're going to click through to users. I'm going to add a user.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.940
Let's call our user, Udacity 1.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.340
We won't be logging in with this user,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.015
so the name doesn't really matter much.

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:32.030
So we're going to select "Programmatic Access".

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.695
So we're just going to get an access key and an API key,

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.450
and that should be enough.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.375
Once we have this,

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:44.330
we're probably never going to log in with this user to the console itself.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.815
I'll just use my current account that we're using to create this.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.715
I click on "Permissions".

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:56.440
Now, I need to choose what I want the user to be able to do.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.290
I will click on "Attach Existing Policies Directly".

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.345
Now I have the option of picking exactly what this user should be able to do.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:11.660
In our case, we want to be able to create infrastructure,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.525
which means we're going to be creating servers,

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:18.885
network components, and access rules, security groups, everything.

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:20.450
We want to be able to do everything.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.785
So in this case,

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:23.420
we have to pick the first one,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.290
the one that says administrator access, because that's what we want.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.425
However, always remember when doing this work in the real world,

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:38.135
you want to provide the least privilege to the person doing the job.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:41.045
So if somebody only needs to create storage resources,

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:43.430
or compute resources, you want to just

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.700
limit their access just to that particular section.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.720
In our case, we're going to be doing everything,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.965
so we need the full axis.

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:57.810
Another way to do it is that some companies would have several AWS accounts.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.520
For example, a development only account,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.900
where you deploy only development resources,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.730
and then the separate production account that has no bearings with development,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.815
and is only accessible by operation.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.025
You would have all kinds of production resources in there.

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.650
This is great because you can provide full admin

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.260
access to your developers and their development environment,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.960
and there's no risk that they're going to break anything because it's

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.255
an isolated AWS account just for that purpose.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:28.450
I get to see that a lot in doing the job.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.945
We get the option of tagging here,

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:36.335
which is just really what it sounds like.

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:39.980
It's a tag you put a name to the resource you are creating.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.020
In this case, since we're creating a user,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.710
the name of the user itself should tell you what it is.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.390
So you don't need an additional tag or label to identify.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.630
This is just a review screen,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.030
where we're confirming the changes that we're doing.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.525
Well, click "Create" and now we have our user.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:07.475
Like I said, the user itself doesn't matter that much,

00:04:07.475 --> 00:04:09.290
because we're never going to login to it.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.375
But we do have an access key,

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:15.480
and we have a secret access key.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.565
This secret access key this is the only time where you get to see it.

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.575
Amazon will not store it anywhere.

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:24.130
What that means is that,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.440
you better save it right now otherwise you'll have to come back

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.230
and create a new one simply because it's

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:37.115
just not going to help you in any way if you lose it for whatever reason.

00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:40.910
By all means please please do not check in any of

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.050
these values the API key or the secret key in your Git repository.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.420
Because that means the rest of your development team will be able to see it,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.870
and if you for some reason push this code to a public repository and

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.420
now you're in trouble because this keys will be visible

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.450
and it could be very harmful for your AWS account.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.100
So is a best practice to keep this very specific to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.200
your machine or in a secure location where it cannot be accessed from the outside world.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.600
So we're just going to leave these values here.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.070
Now we're going to go to the console.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.010
I'm going to configure the AWS command line tool with these values.
