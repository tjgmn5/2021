Hey everyone. Welcome to this course.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.520
In this course, we're going to discuss infrastructure as code. My name is Carlos.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.934
I have a background in software development,

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.440
which then later turned into DevOps,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.935
and then later evolves into Cloud DevOps,

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:18.750
which is the reason why we're here.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.550
Cloud DevOps is the topic of a culture shift where you're going to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.055
see code that actually deploys physical servers instead of software.

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:35.860
Or I should say, a little bit of both is the combination of development and operation.
