00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
With that, I would like to test the script.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.659
So since we have the CLI tool working properly,

00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:11.555
what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and make sure this works,

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:14.925
then we're going to go to the console and verify that it actually work,

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.530
and we'll go from there.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.310
Let's reopen the terminal here.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.490
There's my pointer.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.280
All right.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.540
So let's do a test here,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.990
make sure everything's working properly.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.040
All right. We're ready to go.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.830
So what we're going to do is let's find

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.650
our file which is I believe is called "testcfn". There it is.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.600
The way to deploy it is,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.660
I would do AWS CloudFormation,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.855
and because I already know it doesn't exist,

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:19.545
I'm going to do a create stack command.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.765
Create stack I believe is the command.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:26.190
This command is to create a stack.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.735
A stack in CloudFormation is a group of resources.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:32.480
So right now it's just a text file,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.370
its just a script in YAML format,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.185
so far it's meaningless.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.850
But once we create a stack,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.770
it actually goes out there to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.400
the AWS datacenter and allocates resources that we can actually use.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.490
So this is the part when it becomes a reality.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.880
The infrastructure as code becomes actual infrastructure.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.490
So the Create Stack command is probably going to need stack name.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.580
So we'll do a stack name and call it our first test.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.805
It's probably going to need a region as well.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:13.075
Although I think we defaulted that value but let's just make sure and put US West 2.

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:15.305
There's no parameters.

00:02:15.305 --> 00:02:18.800
So we just have straight up values in our file so we don't need

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.970
that and obviously we're going to need a template body.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:35.195
That template body is going to be a file and that file is "testcfn.yml".

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:39.650
I might be missing something here but errors are good for troubleshooting,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.940
so we'll get to that. All right.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.725
Once we execute this command,

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:48.760
we get our stack ID right away.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.720
With that stack ID, we can go to CloudFormation and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.215
verify something that might be happening.

00:02:55.215 --> 00:02:59.760
A stack when it runs it's based on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.290
events so you'll have creation event which is what's happening now.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.720
It my switch to "in progress" right after that and I'll take awhile there.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.030
Once is "in progress" is done,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.640
it will go to "complete" or it my go to "clean up complete" because sometimes you'll have

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.280
to create temporary resources and those needs to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.190
be destroyed and cleaned up prior to to ending.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.370
This life cycle becomes a lot more interesting when we're doing

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.040
a stack update because not all the time we're

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.025
going to destroy the resources and recreate everything.

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:36.680
There are times when we just want to change

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.950
a little something in a server and we want to be able to do that.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.710
So we just use the create stack command but there's also an update stack command,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.935
and that will help you with that in order to be able to

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:53.960
create updates to your stacks and not just destroy and create every single time.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.124
Right now, since we just created a networking component that is empty,

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:02.000
we can destroy it and recreate it as needed many times,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.245
so there's no harm done.

00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:06.725
Right. Now that we know this's executed,

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.460
let's go to our console and validate our work.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:24.060
So we'll switch back to the AWS console and we're going to type CloudFormation this time.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:35.390
I'm going to click on it. Again, since we fired the script into US West 2,

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.640
make sure that's the region that is displayed.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.770
The appropriate name for it is

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:49.055
Oregon US West Oregon and you will not see it unless you select this region in this case.

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:52.760
Now, we will see that it says our first test and it

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.580
says create complete. So let's take a look.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.840
Here in this stack, you're going to see several items.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.420
The most important to you is going to be the events down

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.360
the bottom because this is where you're going to look for

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.440
error messages if you did something wrong and you're going to have a red event

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.165
that's going to show you an error and that's going to help you troubleshoot your script.

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:19.850
In this case we just have a creative progress that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.300
later transitioned into a create complete.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.390
Let's take a look over here.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:33.465
This is the create complete for the VPC resource we created and it gives you a VPC ID.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:36.950
For AWS, the only thing that matters is the VPC ID.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.290
So remember that name that we gave it,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.745
whatever name it maybe,

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:42.275
it doesn't matter in this case.

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:45.965
But now, we get to verify if this actually worked.

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:49.610
So we'll go to Services or type

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:57.900
VPC and we'll go

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.730
to our US West region,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.080
in this case Oregon right here,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.920
and we'll click VPCs and we should have an additional

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.485
10.0.0.0 /16 which was the value that we specified here in the cider block.

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:13.850
So as you can see,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.140
we have an additional one that we just created and we can

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.785
validate that by looking at the resource ID.

00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:25.735
You see one that says here delta one delta and seven echo alpha.

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:29.500
Let's verify. One of those two is going to be the one we created.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.780
So I'll go back to CloudFormation.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.210
Click "ourfirsttest", This is our stack.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.140
I'll go down here and

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.960
sure enough delta one delta is one of the ones that we created and that's our VPC.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.820
So we've verified that it works but let's try a few other commands.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.760
So I'll go back here.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.205
What happens if I try to create it again? What is it going to do?

00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:03.365
Let's see. If I type the exact same command again, you get an error.

00:07:03.365 --> 00:07:04.805
It says already exists.

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:07.355
That's absolutely perfect. That's what you want.

00:07:07.355 --> 00:07:11.539
So next time if you wanted to change something,

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.125
what you would do is you would send an update stack command.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.000
Okay. Not a create stack.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.535
That was probably your intention here.

00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:24.705
You wanted to update it but you forgot to change the command which still says create and

00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:27.350
it's telling you an error that says this stack

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.050
is already there and has deployed resources.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.320
You probably don't want to create.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.280
Because that will create an override situation.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.390
You never want to override

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.030
resources especially if you're working in your production again.
