00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
However, we need to discuss CloudFormation,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.690
what it is before we even attempt to run something,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.470
because we don't want to be running something that we don't understand.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.060
This is the part where we start talking about infrastructure as code by itself.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.550
When it comes to CloudFormation,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.440
CloudFormation is a declarative language, what that means is,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.020
you declare the resources that you want and you

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.715
allow the logic behind it to take care of everything.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:37.140
I'll give you an example. If you create a server,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.940
it's not your responsibility to tell Amazon,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.595
does this server already exists?

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.020
Is this an update?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.910
Are we creating it from scratch?

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.910
Those things, that will be

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.840
a programmer's type of logic and we don't need you to become a software developer.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.520
If you are an operational person,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.460
you don't need to understand any of that logic,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.685
you can just use this and let Amazon worry about that.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.295
The same goes for interdependencies.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:08.600
So let's say you have a network that you're creating,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.210
an infrastructure and you're also creating a server,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.750
the first thing that comes to mind,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.215
how is it Amazon going to know,

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:23.360
should I create the network first and then deploy a server second on top of that network,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.010
or should it be the other way around?

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.270
Well, again, that's none of your concern,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.580
they have their own server [inaudible] that does all

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.690
this for you so you don't really have to worry about any of that,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.820
you just declare your resources.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.070
There are very rare exceptions when you actually have

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.575
to specify dependencies, for example,

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:45.170
let's say that you are creating a load balancer or

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.240
a web server and this load balancer needs to wait for the web server to be ready,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.640
then you can specify a situation where you would say,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.600
this resource that I'm creating depends on that other resource,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.770
so please wait until the other resource is created before continuing.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.940
You can do that but ideally you want to avoid those situations,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.710
you want to let the server do it's thing,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.060
so you don't have to worry about nothing.
