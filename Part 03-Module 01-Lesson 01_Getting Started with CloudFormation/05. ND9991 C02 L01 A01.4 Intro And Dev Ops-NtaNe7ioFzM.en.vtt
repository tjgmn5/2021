00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Probably one of the biggest benefits of DevOps is

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.759
the introduction of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.594
or us we just call it, CICD.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:16.649
With tools such as Jenkins or Circle CI,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.404
which are tools for continuous integration and deployment,

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:27.585
these tools are going to help developers push features out a lot faster.

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:31.019
Well, we have a continuous integration pipeline.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.325
What we do is, we monitor the repository.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.100
We continuously monitor the repositories.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.448
So every time the developers check-in new code,

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:44.659
this will trigger an automatic process that's going to

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.269
continuously build, perform unit test,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.000
and possibly deploy as well to a development environment or a test environment,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.094
the latest version of the software.

00:00:56.094 --> 00:01:00.829
Now, once this process goes on because usually the developer will need

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.239
several weeks or days or weeks to create a new feature and test it properly.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.994
Once this is done,

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:11.645
we end up running the exact same continuous deployment pipeline

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:13.314
all the way to production,

00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:17.685
which runs the deployment that I just mentioned a moment ago.

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.030
The deployment will trigger

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.004
those necessary steps to get the software properly running in production,

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.319
without you having to worry, "Oh,

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.649
did I forget this library file that's also required by the software?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.440
Did I forget to change the configuration file?"

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.423
You don't forget anything when you have a script that's automated,

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:39.980
performing the task exactly the same every single time.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.310
So predictability is number 1 in DevOps,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.070
you want everything to run automated as possible.
