00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Look like services IM,

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:05.640
and then click users.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.464
You see that we have our user created. I'll click it now.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:11.669
Now, we have a lot of options.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.785
We have groups, tax,

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:16.109
security credentials, and access adviser.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.969
We're going to click on security credentials.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:24.919
Here you'll see we have the access key that we just created,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.615
is there and and it says active,

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:29.059
we can make it inactive. This is great.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.884
When you think that you have lost your key for whatever reason,

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.634
you can make it inactive instead of deleting it,

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:40.219
or basically this is another option if you have

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.515
a CI/CD Pipeline or something that's

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:46.054
automated and you want it not to work for whatever reason.

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:47.975
You just come here and make it inactive.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:49.875
When that thing runs,

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.975
it's going to error out because you disabled the access.

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:58.054
So there are times when you actually need to disable the access and not just delete it.

00:00:58.054 --> 00:01:01.865
As you can see, I have the option here to create an access key.

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:04.215
You just click on it and it works right away.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:05.850
Now, we have two keys.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:07.769
However, I don't want that.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:12.189
So I'm going to go ahead and just click Delete.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.060
So there's that. Since we're messing with this,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.894
let's make sure our key still works.

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:23.519
So, we type the same command,

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:28.664
I always type it by habit to make sure everything is working and everything is fine.

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:31.470
So we have our tool tested,

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.640
we have visual studio code, we have our keys,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
so we're basically fully set up now to start testing.
