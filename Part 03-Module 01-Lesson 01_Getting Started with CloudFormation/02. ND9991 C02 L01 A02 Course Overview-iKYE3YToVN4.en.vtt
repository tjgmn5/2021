00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
In this course, we're going to cover a series of five lessons,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.465
and the first lesson what we're going to do is,

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:10.155
we're going to just get properly set up, introduce the conversation,

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.810
talk about confirmation, and get everything

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.155
properly tested and verified so that we can do our work.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.820
Now in lesson two,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.485
we're going to talk about diagrams.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.045
Obviously in the real world,

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.720
you're going to have a lot of diagrams showing cloud architecture,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.085
and I want you to be able to understand those completely from the ground up.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.680
With that knowledge, then we can go to lesson three,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.080
where we're actually going to go ahead and take that diagram and turn it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.055
into a script or as we call it, Infrastructure as Code.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.415
Lesson four is going to be a continuation of lesson three,

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:47.510
where after we have deployed the networking components,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.610
we're going to actually deployed our servers on top of that infrastructure.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.725
Finally in lesson five,

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.600
we're going to have additional services that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.419
are going to help you build your final project,

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:01.760
such as databases and storage services that you're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.100
going to use along with your final project.
