00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.334
Now, the first resources that we're going to create our called security groups.

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:09.210
Security groups are specific to the resources that we're going to deploy.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.820
You might think that security groups are tied to the subnets,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.000
that's not the case.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.274
Security groups are associated with specific resources, whether it's a load balancer,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:21.750
or whether it's a server that you're trying to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.929
create with a Windows desktop or a Linux server.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.960
The security groups will tell you, "Hey,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.660
you know, we want this port open,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.429
or we want this port closed,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:34.649
and that's basically a protection or

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.469
traffic filter for the machines we're going to deploy."

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.820
So for now, we're going to deploy this.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.170
It's not going to look like we're deploying anything,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.410
it's going to look like it's part of networking, but that's not the case.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.699
Let's take care of those.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.880
It's more of a housekeeping task prior to deploying Servers.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.050
We're going to explain one by one,

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:55.729
but we're going to select all of them right now,

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.709
and push them over to our script,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.109
and make sure we have the proper indentation.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.105
I'll copy that, paste it over here.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.625
So let's understand this resource.

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:17.765
Now, I don't expect you to memorize how to do a security group,

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:24.750
so let me tell you how you find out how to build a security group resource.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.125
You would go back to your browser,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:35.790
you would type CloudFormation security group,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.319
and this is a link to the official documentation,

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.379
and it shows the exact type of resource that we're trying to create.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.350
So we'll go to the YAML format,

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.539
actually it has a copy here that you can just copy it over

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.095
and include it in your script conveniently,

00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:58.825
and these are the properties.

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:02.685
In this case, the group name, description.

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:07.950
The only two critical parameters here are the ingress flow, and egress flow.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.460
In other words, what to do with the traffic that's going to be

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.254
associated with this resource, inbound and outbound.

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:17.180
There are tags and there's PPC Id.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.770
PPC Id makes sense,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.219
it's what's the Container where you're going to place this security group.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.165
Now, the interesting part here is the egress rules,

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:32.069
and the ingress rules. Let's take a look at those.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.185
It will tell you, hey, it's just access rules,

00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:39.610
and it doesn't really explain anything to you,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.960
so you would need to see an example to be able to understand.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.085
Here they have an example in the same page.

00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:51.355
The example says, "From port 80 to port 80,

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:55.459
I want to be able to traffic to and from anywhere."

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.965
in this case the wildcard cider,

00:02:57.965 --> 00:02:59.485
which is zero, zero, zero.

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:01.570
What we're doing here is,

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.269
this will be the setup for an HTTP web server.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.469
If you're running a blog,

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.050
if you're running the corporate page for your business.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.770
This is how you would do it.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.620
You would set up, allow traffic from anywhere as long as it's port 80 to this resource,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.700
which could be a server,

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.949
it could be a load balancer, as we'll see later.
