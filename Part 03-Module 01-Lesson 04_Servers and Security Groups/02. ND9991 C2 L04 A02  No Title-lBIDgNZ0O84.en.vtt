00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
So if we have our architecture here,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.770
what we need to do is go ahead and now start creating a separate file since we

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.020
now have access to the output parameters of the previous network that we created.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.850
So we're just going to start from scratch with

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.730
a brand new YAML file and a matching parameter file.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.505
We're going to use that to create

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.590
basically a brand new infrastructure that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.510
is just going to be for the servers and our software.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.760
This is the actual functional part.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.005
We're going to come here to our repo,

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:35.770
we're going to create a new file.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.490
Make sure it's a YAML file.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.230
I'm going to save it blank for now,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.880
just to have something.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.010
I'm going to call it demoservers.yaml.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.950
I'm going to do the same for the JSON file that we're going to use for parameters.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.530
Again, we're just going to create a blank for now just to have a placeholder,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.130
make sure it is formatted as JSON, and we're going to hit "Save".

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.210
We're going to call this demoservers.json.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.370
Now, I have a similar document that we can use just like we did for the network.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.620
I have a similar reference document that we're going to be using,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.470
and we're going to be building it step-by-step from the perspective of server this time,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.850
not the network. So let's get to that.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.435
This fall right here in the repository.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.350
You will see that we only have one parameter here,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.075
that's very interesting, just one parameter.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:47.620
That's because we're going to be using the environment name,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.160
which we call I belief Udacity project demo.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.660
We're going to be using that value to be referencing

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.475
the output values of the previous networking script that we created.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:02.840
So we just need the part that changes.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.460
In this case, the name which we gave it Udacity project demo,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.700
and then we already know we standardize between

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.930
ourselves and other Cloud formation developers in our team.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.465
We standardized the remainder part of the name.

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:19.400
So we'll get to that pretty soon.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.700
For now, we'll just need to declare this one parameter.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.770
So I'll copy this portion,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.865
even the description of this time.

00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:35.240
Copy, get back to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:43.080
our file, and paste it here.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.435
We don't have anything at this time.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.450
So we'll just going to start adding resources right away.
