00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Here we have our launch configuration and

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.009
we're going to explain it in detail here in a moment.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.134
Let me just make sure that we copy it over to our reference script,

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:18.045
our script that we're coding right now as well as the auto-scaling group.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:23.490
Okay. I'll do copy and bring it

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:32.054
over here, and paste.

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:42.075
Make sure it's properly indented and it looks like we need to push it a little.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.745
Let's see. We're going to do

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:50.339
one tap and verify that it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.870
enough and it's properly aligned with web-server security group.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.119
Perfect. All right.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.424
So what is in our launch configuration?

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:02.375
You're going to have several values here.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.534
Let's start from the bottom.

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:07.909
First, the volume size.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.390
Volume size is how much hard-drive space

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.349
is this machine going to need and where do I put it.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:16.534
So you specify a device name.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.200
If you're familiar with Linux,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.879
device names are mount points where you can actually create folders.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.489
In this case, we're just specifying that we just need

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:29.819
10 gigabytes for this machine and just one drive is more than enough.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.704
Now, what kind of machine?

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:36.079
This is done by specifying T3 medium,

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.789
which is Amazon nomenclature for a specific machine,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.640
whether it is two gigs of RAM,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.015
four gigs of RAM, however much CPU.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:48.650
This is where you select that.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.980
Again, you have to pick whatever is appropriate for your application.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.680
So some applications need a lot more RAM,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
some just need faster CPU and they're okay with having very little RAM.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.820
So it really depends on what your needs are.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.080
In this case, we are doing our first reference to a security group.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.100
In this case, we're using the web-server security group.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.169
That's the one that we decided that it's just going to

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.469
be port eighty open to the world. So there it is.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.344
Now we can optionally apply an SSH key.

00:02:26.344 --> 00:02:32.199
This is obviously, to allow us to log in on that port 22,

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.834
if we choose to do so.

00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:35.530
Again, once you're done

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.539
troubleshooting and you have everything you need from that machine,

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.504
it is best to not have a key at all,

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:44.379
just to have an actual server that does its function and you never

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.454
need to go in there to troubleshoot anything or look for anything at all, right?

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:51.950
Machines, you have to see them as discardable resources,

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.209
just the resources necessary for you to run your software.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.310
You don't need to go in there for any reason.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.115
If it fails, just destroy it, create a new one.

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:03.290
That's why you have an auto-scaling group for those reasons.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:10.764
The image ID is an ID of what you're trying to run.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:12.174
You have a machine image.

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.419
If you understand virtual machines,

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.310
you'll know that they run based off an image of something.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.830
So you have an operating system,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.280
whether it could be Windows, could be Linux,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.189
and those operating systems are baked in into a big file that

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.615
gets loaded at boot time for these virtual machines,

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:34.510
and whatever is in there already installed is what's going to come up in

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:40.250
here as the AMI or Amazon machine image.

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.179
In this case, it is a Linux machine and where

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.189
we're going to install a terminal web server.
