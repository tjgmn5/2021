00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
However, there is one that was very important which will be the next one,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.640
and that's the availability zone.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.745
I'm going to drag this over here and expand it.

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:15.879
You can think of an availability zone as a data center,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.105
as a physical building housing your computer and services.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:25.755
This availability zone is within the region that you're working in obviously,

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:33.179
and it helps you design diagrams that are multi-availability zones.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:34.964
You always want to have more than one,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.455
ideally two or more always.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.274
The reason why that is is because

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:47.359
AZs or availability zones are designed to be resilient by themselves,

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.579
meaning that if something bad happens in one of

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.265
them it doesn't necessarily affect the other one.

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.535
This is great and this is critical for you to understand.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.309
When you're doing a diagram,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.750
every time you're dropping components on the screen,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
you want to be able to tell yourself where is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.084
the single point of failure in my diagram before you actually go implement it.

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:10.759
You never want to have single points of failures in your diagram.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.585
For example, if you put everything in a single availability zone,

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:18.034
you are risking yourself that if something happens to this datacenter,

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:19.608
whether it's a fire,

00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:21.319
or an electrical failure,

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:28.003
or temperature goes over certain value and the computers overheat,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:29.800
if something happens in this place,

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.414
your application will be down and you could lose data or resources.

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:39.274
So if you want to design an application that is highly available,

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:44.370
always think about having more than one availability zone.

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:49.549
A question that you will see in a certification exam would be can you design

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.299
this diagram for for high availability?

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.500
What they're asking you is, "Hey,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.540
make sure that there's two of everything.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.980
At least two or more."

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.880
Or can you optimize this design for a cost?

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.515
When they tell you about cost,

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:05.840
they tell you, okay,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.694
get rid of high availability because this is probably just a test environment.

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.530
So do a single availability zone,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.699
which would mean you would have

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.509
less high availability and you will have more risk of failure,

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.629
but you will optimize for costs so it will be cheaper to run.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.099
Those are the questions that they ask you around exams for

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.435
Cloud certification as to think about cost or high availability.

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:36.409
So as I was saying, let's make sure we have two of these in our design.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.590
I will drag this down here.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.775
Probably need to expand the overall Cloud to include some more space for us.

00:02:47.775 --> 00:02:50.890
Let's see. I'm going to put this down here.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.599
Now, so far, even though we have

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.039
two availability zones within an account and we have some users over here,

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.379
we really have nothing

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.639
because an availability zone it doesn't represent anything, it's nothing that you build.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.469
It's already there, you get to use it.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.960
So far, we haven't really done anything from the point of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.455
view of something that will be turned into a script.

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:21.320
So what we're going to do now is when it

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.354
actually starts to get into the networking portion.

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:27.729
We're going to start that by doing a VPC.
