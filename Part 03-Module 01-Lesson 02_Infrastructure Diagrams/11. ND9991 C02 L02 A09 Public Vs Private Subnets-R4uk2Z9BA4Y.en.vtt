00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.950
Let's do another couple of subnets and I'll explain why in a second.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.440
So I'm going to throw this one in here,

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:17.439
and I'm going to do another one down here,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.019
and I'm going to rename this and I'm going to call them a private Subnet

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.089
1 and 2, private Subnet 1.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.000
These are just labels so that we can tell them apart.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.115
So it's not really critical at this time,

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:36.690
and after all, it's just a diagram,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:40.804
we're not really writing a specific infrastructure as code just yet,

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:43.409
so bear with me here.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.574
So we have private Subnet 1 and 2 and the other ones I'll call public.

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:53.210
Now, like I said, that's just a label distinction right now.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.575
I wonder what can we do with that information.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:01.700
So the real goal here is to use the IP addresses in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.784
this subnets as our key for routing traffic.

00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:08.765
Let me explain what that means.

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:10.870
If you have a routing table,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.070
you can use that routing table to say, "Hey,

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.009
I want this traffic to stay within my VPC or

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.420
this traffic to just go to this one subnet or to that subnet."

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.680
That's the basics of networking.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.435
What we do with that is we use it as an element of security.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:31.454
So in our private subnets,

00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:33.319
we're going to deploy, let's say, a database,

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.759
something that has very sensitive and critical data for your business,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.930
you don't want that exposed to the Internet.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.730
However, if you have

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.215
a web server showing the applications and talking about your company,

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:47.960
obviously, you want people in

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.469
the outside world to be able to see this information and say,

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.289
"Hey, this is a public facing server.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.660
We want everybody to be able to see this server."

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.769
You would put a such a server and what we call a public subnet.

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:03.920
In that subnet, what you're going to have is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.955
this server running and receiving inbound Internet traffic from any source.

00:02:08.955 --> 00:02:10.110
Obviously, as a web server,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.155
you want it to be accessible from anywhere.

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:13.564
However, like I mentioned,

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:14.900
you don't want that to happen to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.569
your database or anything that's sensitive for your company.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.549
You don't want that exposed to the Internet.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.100
So there comes the concept of a private subnet.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.239
This is where you're going to deploy your sensitive data,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.230
and then we're going to use routing rules and

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.139
security group which we're going to introduce here in a moment,

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.789
and those will help you block access to those things.
