00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.720
A very interesting service that you can use in

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.500
the Cloud is called load balancing. Let's take a look.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.100
Load balancers is a service simply designed to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.235
distribute a work request meant for target group.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.350
So what is a target group?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.505
A target group is just a collection of servers that provide a common service.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.170
So for example, if you have

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.325
an image processing application that is taking requests and it will take,

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.890
say an image and it will gather

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.580
metadata out of that image or generate a thumbnail and store it somewhere,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.640
you would have a load balancer in front.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.270
This load balancer will manage all the requests coming in and it will distribute

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.880
those requests across many different servers

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.210
that you have providing the exact same service.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.895
This is an illustration of what I'm talking about.

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:53.010
You have the load balancer symbol here.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.120
You have three instances or three servers inside your auto scaling group and

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.830
let's say all three obviously have

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.625
the exact same image processing application that you created.

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.600
If we get 300 request right now,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.230
the load balancer will save 100 to each one of your three servers.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.810
Now because you have an auto scaling group,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.430
you will have a criteria,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.755
let's say the number of requests,

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.260
that will allow this auto scaling group to spin up

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.735
more servers as needed to keep up with the demand of your service.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:28.000
If the man goes down,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.425
the auto-scaling will scale back down to

00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:33.290
three servers or whatever you say that's the minimum.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.560
So remember, the job of the load balancer is to spread the work load evenly across

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.680
the target group and the target group is however many

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.610
servers you have available to provide a common service.
