00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
Here we have lucidchart.com which is a standard diagram tool.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.090
You could probably do the same with a tool like Visio or Cloudcraft,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.730
those are very popular tools for designing diagrams,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.180
but we're going to use Lucidchart today.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.320
It's free, you can open an account here and then you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.095
use it for your Cloud related diagrams.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.020
We're going to start with a blank diagram.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:33.435
I need to delete this older one here,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.860
which I'm going to do now.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.890
The only requirement that you have once you open the default diagram screen is that you

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.750
better have enable AWS Architecture 2017,2019.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.740
This is what's going to give you the ability to draw and read AWS diagrams.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.540
Now in this tool, we're going to start with a blank screen,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.325
what you're looking at right now,

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.940
and then we're going to start working with AWS diagram.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.310
But first, let me stop right here and tell you what it is that we're trying to do.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.965
Whenever you have a Cloud architecture,

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:29.330
you're going to have a diagram which explains that architecture.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.390
You never really going to start from scratch and try to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.190
do code or Infrastructure as Code from a vision in your head.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.165
You need to put it on paper to be able to communicate that with your team.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:44.455
One of the best way to do it is with visuals.

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.250
As you know a visual is worth 1,000 words,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.395
probably more than that.

00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:54.710
So when somebody hands you over a diagram,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.290
maybe a person that is a senior solutions architect,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.470
and tell you, "Hey, go ahead end your job and implement this."

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.575
What they mean is, take this diagram and turn into a CloudFormation script,

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:10.125
deploy into production or tests, and get back to me.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:12.240
So in this case,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.480
you need to be able to read that diagram.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.600
So I'm not going to teach you exactly how to read it,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.580
I'm going to teach you how to do it yourself,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.660
which in turn will make you a very proficient in terms of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.400
reading the diagrams themselves once you see them out in the real world.
