00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
So now in our architecture where we are right now,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.015
is very very solid, it's secure.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:07.590
We have security groups, we have

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.965
private subnets that are not exposing anything to the internet,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:12.480
and we have public subnet,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.060
exposing what we want to expose, in this case,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.030
NAT service that is used by private subnets,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.355
and we also have web services that are behind a load balancer.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.690
One distinction that is good to make about the load balancer,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.790
you see it's a single component.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.320
What it's going to require that you have more than one subnet.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.675
In fact, I can show you right now,

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:41.010
I'm going to look for cloud formation,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.590
and I'm going to type "application load balancer".

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.600
We're going to click on the listing here,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.390
this is the documentation for that.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.560
One of the things that I wanted you to notice here is that it has

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.930
a value here that says "subnets" in the definition for a load balancer.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.870
We're going to click "Subnets",

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.060
and in the definition for our subnets or application load balancer,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.890
it says that you must specify at least two availability zones.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.455
This is very important.

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.210
What that means is, even though you see as a single point of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.945
entry or possibly a single point of failure in our diagram,

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.350
don't think that that's the case,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.000
this application load balancer is going to be spread across two of your [inaudible].

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.935
What that means is, it is also bound to what we said earlier.

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:42.100
If we have a failure in one data center,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.410
your service still going to continue to run in the other.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.415
The same applies for the Internet gateway and the routing and the autoscaling.

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:52.970
Those things you can assume safely that they're not going to fail,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.380
because they have multiple copies of those services running behind the scenes for you.
