00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.759
Our goal in this lesson is to get you comfortable in

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:06.494
the creation and interpretation of Cloud network and diagrams.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:10.109
Just in case this is your first time building a network from scratch,

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.230
let me give you a few quick concepts for your reference.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.300
For example, we're looking at a virtual private Cloud, or VPC.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.630
A VPC is simply a network segment or container that is isolated from the other networks.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:31.169
So any computers or devices that you deploy within a VPC can easily talk to each other,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.340
but they can not reach other networks such as the Internet,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.225
unless you create a specific routing to allow this.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:41.960
Thanks to VPCs, you can have

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.009
several completely independent networks within your AWS account,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.604
such as production and development,

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:54.384
where you may want to have completely separate and isolated network traffic, for example.

00:00:54.384 --> 00:01:01.570
VPCs can be split further into smaller network segments that we know as subnets.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.614
Then you can apply routing rules to those subnets, for example,

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:09.699
to allow Internet traffic to one subnet but not another.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.850
Another benefit of subnets that you get from the Cloud is that you can have

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.094
one subnet in a separate data center, then another subnet.

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.739
This is known as high availability because if you lose

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:25.219
electricity or network connectivity to one of your subnets,

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.730
you can still see the other subnets within your VPC,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.040
and if you design your application correctly,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.240
it will be able to continue normal operation.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.349
This is our target network deployment.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:43.114
We're just going to have two public subnets and two private subnets within a VPC.

00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:48.604
The public ones will have two-way Internet access that's why we call them public.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:53.165
The private ones will have one way traffic only.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:56.180
Ultimately, we're trying to build a diagram that

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.405
contains all the elements of a web application deployment,

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.614
including a load balancer,

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:06.024
web servers with our application running,

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:12.680
networking elements such as the Internet Gateway and NAT Gateways, and finally,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.115
the network itself, which is made up of the VPC,

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:20.570
public and private subnets and routing rules.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.924
So without further ado,

00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:27.030
let's build this infrastructure diagram step-by-step.
