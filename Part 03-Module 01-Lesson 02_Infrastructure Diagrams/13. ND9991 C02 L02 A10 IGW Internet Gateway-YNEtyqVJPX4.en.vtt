00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
Now, it's going get more interesting because we have to talk about Internet access,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.260
and let's do that right now.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.340
So as we have said,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.875
a Virtual Private Cloud or VPC is a networking container,

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:19.950
and this is what we're looking at right now.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.150
Now, it is completely isolated from the world,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.315
from everything, there's no way to get in here.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:31.905
So how is something public if we can't access,

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.270
right? It doesn't make sense.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.205
So I'm going to do is,

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:45.100
I am going to introduce you to a service here called an internet gateway.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.915
The internet gateway, what it does is,

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:55.415
we're going to put it in right here at the edge of our VPC.

00:00:55.415 --> 00:01:01.295
The Internet gateway provides inbound and outbound traffic to your VPC.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:04.040
That doesn't mean everybody can get in just yet,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.750
we're going to get to that part,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.915
but we need this component to be able to access the VPC.

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:14.120
Obviously, it doesn't make sense if you create resources in data center that belongs

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.250
to Amazon Web Services somewhere if you cannot access that from your company, right?

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.215
There's no sense there.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:27.485
So the internet gateway is going provide us the way to go in and out.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:30.530
Now you may ask yourself,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.190
what if I have only private resources in this Cloud?

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.330
Could I use the Cloud if I don't have anything to share with the public?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.960
Let's say that I'm running a human resources application,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.510
something internal and specific that only

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.890
belongs to your internal company and may not be shared with anybody else,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.960
can I still use the Cloud in this case?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.385
The answer is yes,

00:01:52.385 --> 00:01:54.480
you would not have an internet gateway,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.210
you will probably have a VPN connection or a direct connect connection into your Cloud.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.140
Direct connect is a service that you can buy directly from

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.855
Amazon or directly from a telecom provider.

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:13.130
You can reach out to a telecom provider and they'll put

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.070
a physical line from your office to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.800
the Cloud and that will give you a complete security because there's no

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.620
going through public internet traffic in any way,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.245
you will have complete access to your Cloud

00:02:24.245 --> 00:02:31.570
and it would only be routable using internal private IP addresses.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.470
There will be no public IP addresses so it's impossible to reach from the outside.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.670
But in our case, the one that we are designing here,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.930
we're going to have public web servers so we need an internet gateway so that we can put

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.495
those servers in a place where they can access and be accessed from the outside world.

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:54.370
Now, we're facing a little problem here.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.300
If we wanted to provide internet access to our private servers, how do we do that?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.580
Because those servers may need to download

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.555
software patches or configuration changes that come from the public internet.

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:13.190
In fact, Amazon services such as S3 which is the storage service,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.030
is actually a public service which means

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.690
that if you want to access that from your private subnet,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.690
you need a way to get out and be able to access.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.005
So even though we're calling them private,

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:28.250
whatever you put in there,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.345
still needs to have a way to have outbound internet access.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.560
Let's take a look at that now.
