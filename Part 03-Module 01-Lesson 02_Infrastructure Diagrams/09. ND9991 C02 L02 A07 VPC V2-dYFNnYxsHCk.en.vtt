00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.260
Let's take a moment to go over some definitions.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.290
Virtual private clouds and subnets within

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.070
that cloud follow the same rules as traditional networking.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.130
So let's take a look at those before moving forward.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.110
The main attribute of your VPC is to block of available IP addresses,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.860
also known as the address space and the CIDR block.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.040
These simply imply the number of

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.140
available IP addresses that you will have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.585
to deploy resources within this private network,

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:35.040
such as Windows servers,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.020
Linux servers, databases and so on.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.480
Each one of these will require its own IP address.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.310
Each number in this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.720
10.0.0.0 it's called an octet because each number has eight bits in binary,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.940
it can go from 0-255.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.684
So in this example,

00:00:56.684 --> 00:01:04.020
10.0.0.0/16 means reserve the top 16 bits,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.530
that is, two octets or the first two numbers to be the fixed part of this network.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.810
This is in the same way the area code in your phone number,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.900
it's the same for a large group of phone numbers.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.550
This leaves you with the last two numbers,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.325
two octets or 16 bits,

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.480
available for your IP addresses.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.325
How many IPs is that?

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:34.755
Let's see, 256 times 256,

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:37.965
gives you around 65,000 IP addresses,

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:41.150
which is plenty for most use cases.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.235
Now, a subnet is simply a small subset

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:49.150
of those 65,000 IP addresses available in our example.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.265
But why do I need a subnet?

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:58.149
What is the purpose? Well, a subnet creates logical separation between resources,

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.615
say separate production from development,

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:08.395
it can help you easily block or allow access to and from resources through routing,

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.930
and it can help you by providing services such as

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.130
public internet access to a specific set of resources and not to others.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.160
So back to our example,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.915
if our VPC is 10.0.0.0/16,

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:28.280
meaning that the top two numbers are fixed in place,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.440
we could create a subnet and call it 10.0.1.0/24.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.329
Meaning that the top three numbers or three octets,

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.954
totaling 24 bits are constant,

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:49.325
with eight bits available for addresses or 255 IP addresses.

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:57.470
I could create 255 of this smaller subnets within our VPC by doing 10.0.2.0,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.285
10.0.3.0, and so on.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.880
So to recap, the main goal of the VPC is to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.300
provide private IP address space for your network and resources.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.895
A subnet is simply a smaller chunk of that IP address space.

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:17.360
The slash number at the end of an address represents the number of bits

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.405
that are constant for this VPC or subnet from left to right.

00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:29.220
Having subnets help you with routing and providing services to and from your resources.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.160
Remember to create networks and subnets with future expansion in mind,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.920
you will likely need more IP addresses than you think.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.760
The VPC container is one of these.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.260
We're going to drag it over.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.260
This is very interesting because the VPC has the ability to

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.695
span over several availability zones.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:03.280
So now, we have a VPC covering both of our availability zones.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.790
Again, so far the only thing that we created is the VPC.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.040
Those availability zones are already there,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.330
you don't need to worry about those,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.210
those are there available for you.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.555
Now, when we actually going to create something inside our VPC,

00:04:19.555 --> 00:04:23.850
now is going to be specific to one of these zones that we have,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.740
and that's going to be called a subnet.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.445
I'm going to drop a subnet in here,

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:34.330
I'm going to make it small because I'm going to need several of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.910
these and I'm going to explain what they are.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.120
In this case, we're going to call them private subnet.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.020
Actually no, we're going to name this as public subnet.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.610
Let me change the name here and specify public subnet.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.040
I'm going to zoom in so you can see better.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.705
I'm going to do the same for the other one.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:09.470
I'm going to call it public subnet.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.955
We can call it 1 and 2 in order to be able to distinguish them.

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:15.440
We're going to have private ones,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.410
but right now let's call this Public Subnet 1 and 2,

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.210
and this is what we have for right now.
