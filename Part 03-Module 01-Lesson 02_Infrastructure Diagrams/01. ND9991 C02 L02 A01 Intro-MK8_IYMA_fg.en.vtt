00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Now in this lesson, we're going to cover diagrams.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:08.955
In the previous lesson, we just discussed how to get our CLI tool properly set up.

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.520
Everything is running correctly.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.260
But we're going to take a break from

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.190
CloudFormation scripts and we're going to go into diagrams now.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.740
Diagrams are very, very important because that's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.950
where everything that's cloud-related begins.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.080
They may not be super important in

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.350
the real world where you actually set up a physical server that

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.760
you can touch and install on your datacenter and connect it to your network,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.970
that's perfect in the real world because you get

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.920
to really get to see it and test and verify.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.525
Now, in the cloud,

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:43.209
since you don't have physical access to that datacenter,

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.575
you're going to need diagrams and then turn

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:49.250
those diagrams into actual infrastructure called scripts.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.780
So let's get started.
