00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
One of the main benefits of the cloud is that it allows you to

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.310
stop guessing about capacity when you need to run your applications.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.659
When applications run in a traditional on-premises data center,

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.089
you have to buy your servers upfront.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.140
Sometimes you buy too much,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.344
or you don't buy enough to support the running of your applications.

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:25.289
With elasticity, your servers, databases,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.919
and application resources can automatically scale up or scale down based on the load,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.105
or how many users are using your applications at a given time.

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:41.504
Resources can scale up or vertically and Amazon EC2,

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:44.960
this can easily be achieved by stopping an instance

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.695
and resizing it to an instance type that has more RAM,

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:53.164
CPU, IO, etc., or you can scale

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:57.784
out or horizontally which increases the number of resources.

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:01.529
An example would be adding more servers.
